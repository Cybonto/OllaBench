            The grand challenge that most CEO's care about is maintaining the right level of cybersecurity at a minimum cost as companies are not able to reduce cybersecurity risks despite their increased cybersecurity investments [[1]](https://www.qbusiness.pl/uploads/Raporty/globalrisk2021.pdf). Fortunately, the problem can be explained via interdependent cybersecurity (IC) [[2]](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w8871/w8871.pdf). Human factors account for half of the long-lasting challenges in IC as identified by Kianpour et al. [[3]](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/24/13677), and Laszka et al. [[4]](http://real.mtak.hu/21924/1/Buttyan4.pdf). Unfortunately, human-centric research within the context of IC is under-explored while research on general IC has unrealistic assumptions about human factors. Fortunately, the dawn of Large Language Models (LLMs) promise a much efficient way to research and develop solutions to human-centric problems across domains. We also note that the Zero-trust principles require the evaluation, validation, and continuous monitoring of AI applications including LLMs.

            Therefore, OllaBench was born to help both researchers and application developers conveniently evaluate their LLM models within the context of cybersecurity compliance or non-compliance behaviors. The main goal is to help with identifying the right LLM in the early phase of developing an LLM-based application.</div>
