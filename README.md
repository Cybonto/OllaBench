# OllaBench

## Overview
The grand challenge that most CEO's care about is maintaining the right level of cybersecurity at a minimum cost as companies are not able to reduce cybersecurity risks despite their increased cybersecurity investments [[1]](https://www.qbusiness.pl/uploads/Raporty/globalrisk2021.pdf). Fortunately, the problem can be explained via interdependent cybersecurity (IC) [[2]](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w8871/w8871.pdf) as follows. First, optimizing cybersecurity investments in existing large interdependent systems is already a well-known non-convex difficult problem that is still yearning for new solutions. Second, smaller systems are growing in complexity and interdependence. Last, new low frequency, near simultaneous, macro-scale risks such as global pandemics, financial shocks, geopolitical conflicts have compound effects on cybersecurity.

Human factors account for half of the long-lasting challenges in IC as identified by Kianpour et al. [[3]](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/24/13677), and Laszka et al. [[4]](http://real.mtak.hu/21924/1/Buttyan4.pdf). Unfortunately, human-centric research within the context of IC is under-explored while research on general IC has unrealistic assumptions about human factors. Fortunately, the dawn of Large Language Models (LLMs) promise a much efficient way to research and develop solutions to problems across domains. In cybersecurity, the Zero-trust principles require the evaluation, validation, and continuous monitoring and LLMs are no exception.

Therefore, OllaBench was born to help both researchers and application developers conveniently evaluate their LLM models within the context of cybersecurity compliance or non-compliance behaviors.


OllaBench benchmark scripts and leaderboard results will be published later in FEB after I submit my entry into nVidia's Generative AI Developer Challenge. For now, please check out its Dataset Generator and sample Datasets at the [OllaGen1](https://github.com/Cybonto/OllaBench/tree/main/OllaGen-1) subfolder.
