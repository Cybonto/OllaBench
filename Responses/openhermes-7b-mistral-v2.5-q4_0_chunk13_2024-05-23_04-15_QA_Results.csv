Explanation: Both Noah Kim and Sophia Hernandez show concern for information security within their organization, but they approach it differently. 

Noah Kim seems to adhere to the institutional norms of information security policies and values compliance with them. This suggests that Noah Kim has a positive attitude towards following these policies, believes in their importance (belief), perceives the vulnerability of potential security breaches (vulnerability) and understands the efficacy of response measures (response efficacy). These constructs align with the 'Norms', 'Belief', 'Attitude', 'Self-efficacy', and 'Vulnerability' factors in option b.

On the other hand, Sophia Hernandez seems to have a more critical view of the institution's information security policies, viewing them as a useless endeavor. This suggests that she might not fully agree with the group norms (group norms) surrounding information security within her organization. Her attitude towards these policies is negative, and she doesn't seem to perceive a high threat severity or vulnerability from violating them. These constructs align with 'Norms', 'Belief', 'Attitude', 'Vulnerability', and 'Knowledge' in option b. However, her lack of positive response efficacy belief makes option c more fitting for Noah Kim rather than Sophia Hernandez.
  
Option a is missing some key cognitive constructs present in both cases like attitude and belief. 

Option c doesn't fully capture the differing beliefs and attitudes towards the information security policies of each individual, as well as the differing perceived efficacy of response measures in Noah Kim's case. 

Option d misses some key cognitive constructs present in both cases like attitude and vulnerability. It also includes 'subjective norms', which aren't explicitly mentioned in either case.

Working closely together in the same team could potentially lead to an increased risk of security non-compliance.

On the other hand, Sophia Hernandez views following the institution's Information Security Policies as a useless endeavor, which could lead to potential non-compliance issues. When working closely together, there is a possibility that this difference in attitudes towards information security could lead to misunderstandings or even violations of the organization's policies.

Explanation: 
Cognitive Behavioral Constructs are an essential part of the Health Belief Model, which is used to understand health-related behaviors. The model is composed of five main elements: Moral, Intent, Self-efficacy, Attitude, and Threat severity. These elements help us to understand how individuals make decisions about their health and wellbeing.

In this case, Samantha Brown appears to be someone who values integrity, honesty, and maintaining security policies. This indicates that her moral beliefs are aligned with the company's interests. Her potential admission of unfair business practices and concerns about sharing passwords suggest she has a clear understanding (self-efficacy) of the potential impacts of her actions. The overall attitude seems to be a mix of both positive and negative, indicating that she may be struggling with balancing loyalty to the company with personal gain. The perceived threat severity is not clearly stated but could be inferred from her statements about mishandling sensitive information.

Emily Rodriguez appears to prioritize compliance with organizational policies, which demonstrates her moral alignment with her employer. Her lack of commitment to the organization suggests that she might not see the direct benefits of the company's growth for herself, thus affecting her self-efficacy and intent. She seems to be empathetic towards the company's issues but does not necessarily identify with them personally. The threat severity is not clearly defined, but given her focus on compliance, she may perceive the risks associated with privacy breaches as significant.

Thus, the option that best fits both Samantha Brown and Emily Rodriguez is 'Moral', 'Intent', 'Self-efficacy', 'Attitude', and 'Threat severity'. This option reflects the different perspectives and attitudes each individual holds towards their company and its policies.",1,"Who is MORE compliant with information security policies?

When employees with differing values and commitment levels work closely together, it can create a situation where one employee might influence the other to compromise on information security. In this case, Samantha Brown's admittance of unfair business practices and potential mishandling of sensitive information could lead Emily Rodriguez, who values compliance with Information Security Policies, to engage in non-compliant behavior as well. Additionally, Brown's skill in cybersecurity protection software might allow her to potentially bypass or manipulate the security measures put in place by the organization, further increasing the risk of non-compliance.",0,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?

To increase information security compliance, it would be most effective to target the cognitive behavioral factor of self-efficacy. Self-efficacy refers to an individual's belief in their ability to successfully perform a specific task or achieve a particular goal. In this case, increasing the employees' self-efficacy in following information security policies can lead to better compliance rates.

When individuals have higher levels of self-efficacy, they are more likely to take action and persevere despite obstacles. They also tend to be more resistant to peer pressure, which could be helpful in situations where employees are not following the rules of information security due to fear of being judged by colleagues.

To increase self-efficacy, organizations can provide targeted training and resources that help employees understand their role in maintaining information security, as well as the potential consequences of neglecting these policies. This training should also focus on developing practical skills for navigating cybersecurity software and implementing best practices at work.

Targeting knowledge to increase information security compliance is crucial because the more employees understand the potential risks and consequences of a breach, as well as the importance of following security protocols, the more likely they are to adhere to those protocols. By providing comprehensive training and resources on information security policies and best practices, organizations can help employees better understand the significance of their actions and the implications of non-compliance. This can lead to a stronger sense of responsibility and accountability among employees, ultimately resulting in greater compliance with information security measures.",1,4

Having both Samantha Lee and Matthew Moore in the same team could potentially lead to a higher risk of information security non-compliance. While they both value adhering to organizational policies, having them work closely together could create opportunities for oversights or misunderstandings, leading to potential security risks. For example, if they have different interpretations of certain policies, this could lead to conflicting actions that inadvertently result in non-compliance. Additionally, the increased collaboration may introduce new risks that they haven't encountered before, further increasing the likelihood of non-compliance. However, it is ultimately up to the team to effectively communicate and manage these potential risks to minimize their impact on information security.",1,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?

Given the information provided, it is difficult to determine with certainty if the security non-compliance risk level will increase. However, there are potential factors that could contribute to an increased risk:

1. Olivia Brooks values personal relationships over strictly following information security measures, which may lead her to prioritize those relationships over adhering to protocols when working closely with Emily Smith.
2. Emily Smith plans on intentionally violating information security protocols within their organization. If she is working closely with Olivia Brooks, this could create opportunities for Emily to influence or coerce Olivia into participating in non-compliant behaviors.
3. Both individuals have access to the same computer resources and guidelines, which may increase the chances of misuse or inadvertent breaches due to close collaboration on projects or tasks.

Overall, while it is impossible to predict with certainty, the security non-compliance risk level may increase if these employees work closely together in the same team.
