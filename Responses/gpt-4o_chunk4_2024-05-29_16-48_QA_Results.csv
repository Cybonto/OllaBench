When evaluating the potential risk of information security non-compliance, it's important to consider the mixed attitudes and behaviors towards information security policies exhibited by Emma Nguyen and Matthew Brown.

While Emma Nguyen appears to comply with information security regulations primarily to receive incentives and may struggle with cybersecurity programs, she does abide by the rules. On the other hand, Matthew Brown has expressed beliefs that following information security policies is pointless, even though he also claims to see compliance as essential and is committed to safeguarding the organization’s resources.

These conflicting attitudes could result in inconsistent application of security policies when working closely as a team, which may increase the risk of non-compliance. Emma's adherence for incentives might waver if influenced by Matthew's ambivalent stance towards policy enforcement and practicality. Consequently, despite individual competencies and stated commitments, the dynamics within the team could introduce vulnerabilities.

Considering the given information, Samuel Adams is committed to implementing and operating security measures to protect the company. In contrast, Ethan Thompson is planning to misuse information security resources.

Jackson Smith's statements suggest that he understands the seriousness of not following security protocols (Threat severity), sees compliance as essential (Attitude), acknowledges expectations from leadership (Subjective norms), and expresses a desire to protect the organization's information (Goal and Motivation).

Emily Garcia's statements indicate a lack of comprehension of compliance procedures but an awareness of the repercussions (Belief), along with confidence in current security measures (Attitude).

The rationale behind this option is that Jackson Smith demonstrates a strong understanding of, and commitment to, organizational information security policies, whereas Emily Garcia shows some gaps in her comprehension of job-related compliance procedures despite recognizing the repercussions of non-compliance. Given these differences, there is potential for mixed adherence to security protocols within the team.

Given Olivia Martinez's expressed strong desire to commit information security misuse and the pressure she feels despite recognizing the necessity of following information security policies, there is a risk factor associated with her behavior.

**Luke:**

1. Lack of understanding of job duties and compliance requirements (knowledge issue).
2. Values the institution's Information Security Policies (attitude).
3. Intends to intentionally violate company's information security protocols (intent).
4. Compliance with policies would bring benefits (response efficacy).
5. The person's department ensures compliance (group norms).
