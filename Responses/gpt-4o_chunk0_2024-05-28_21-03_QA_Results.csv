  - **Commitment**: Views following the institution's Information Security Policies as mandatory.
  - **Self-efficacy**: Struggles to effectively utilize cybersecurity defense systems.",0,"Who is MORE compliant with information security policies? Your answer must begin with (option

Given the provided information, placing these employees in the same team could elevate the risk of non-compliance with information security policies. Andrew Brown adheres to rules mainly for incentives, which might not be a reliable motivator to ensure strict and consistent compliance. On the other hand, Grace Kim values the institution's security policies but struggles with effectively utilizing cybersecurity tools.

- ""Compliance with information security policies leads to advantageous outcomes for the individual."" (Control/Attitude)

- ""The individual values personal relationships over strict adherence to company rules."" (Attitude)

For Isabella Garcia:
- ""The individual verbally expressed their commitment to safeguarding the assets of their company."" (Intent/Commitment)
- ""The individual desires to follow the established security protocols of the organization."" (Norms)
- ""The individual expressed their compliance with their company's information security protocols."" (Norms)
- ""The individual views following the institution's Information Security Policies as an obligation."" (Norms)

This could potentially lead to situations where personal relationships influence security decisions. On the other hand, Isabella views information security as an obligation and possesses the means to engage in breaches, which might become a risk factor if influenced by external pressures or relationships. Therefore, their interaction in the same team might create an environment where the risk of non-compliance could increase due to these dynamics.",1,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?

- He actively contributes to the development of the organization, aligning with ""Social"" norms and responsibilities.

Adam Jones:
- His co-workers are actively promoting information security, reflecting a ""Social"" environment.
- Adam himself mentions a commitment to following the organization's policies, suggesting strong ""Intent"" and adherence to ""Norms.""
- The organization's strict action against violators and the time-consuming nature of following policies illustrates the ""Costs"" involved in maintaining information security.
