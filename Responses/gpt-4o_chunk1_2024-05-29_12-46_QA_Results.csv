### Ethan Garcia:
1. **Engaged, energetic, and confident on the job** - This indicates a strong **Affect** (positive emotional disposition towards the job).
2. **Adhering to the company's safety protocols** - This suggests compliance with **Norms** (social and organizational expectations).
3. **Acknowledging the importance of following their organization's information security policies** - This indicates recognition of **Group norms** (shared standards within the organization).

### James Garcia:
1. **Dedicated to enforcing company protocols for safeguarding confidential data** - This suggests commitment to **Norms** and **Group norms**.
2. **Willing to break the rules to achieve their goals** - This might indicate a strong goal orientation but weak adherence to **Norms**.
3. **Believes their organization is unfair to employees** - This relates to an attitude about the organizational environment, likely related to **Norms** and **Subjective norms**.
4. **Productive and spirited with strong self-esteem** - This signals **Affect** (positive emotional state and self-regard).
5. **Expressed desire to safeguard the company's data and technological assets** - This again points towards **Norms** and **Group norms**.

Response efficacy refers to an individual's belief that following a particular action or protocol will effectively mitigate a threat or achieve a desired outcome. Targeting response efficacy involves strengthening the belief that adhering to the organization's security protocols will successfully prevent potential data breaches and safeguard information.

Both Olivia White and James Richards demonstrate an awareness of and a commitment to following security protocols. However, Olivia White is struggling with stress related to her job and expresses concerns about sharing passwords, indicating that she might benefit from increased confidence in these protocols' effectiveness. Reinforcing response efficacy can help bolster her confidence that following security measures will indeed protect information. 

James Richards is already dedicated and eager to follow security protocols, but ensuring he fully believes in their efficacy will support his compliance and likely enhance his ability to advocate for these measures within the organization.

Given the insights on both Alexander Davis and Tyler Jones, it appears that strengthening subjective norms would be most effective. Subjective norms refer to the perceived social pressure to perform or not perform a particular behavior. 

1. For Alexander Davis, although the majority of colleagues advocate for implementing security technology, his rebellious nature and personal circumstances still impede adherence to policies. Strengthening subjective norms by emphasizing the collective expectations and pressures from colleagues and supervisors to follow policies could potentially guide his behavior more effectively.

2. For Tyler Jones, who values adherence to organizational security measures and considers it a crucial obligation, reinforcing the subjective norms about the importance and expectation of following information security policies may bolster his commitment and influence his motivation to adhere even more strictly.

By targeting subjective norms, both individuals may feel a stronger influence from their peers and supervisors, thus increasing their compliance with information security policies.",0,1

Given the information, it is clear that the department already disregards information security policies, and there is a prevailing attitude of non-compliance among the majority of employees. Since Sophia Nguyen appears to be aware of the grave consequences of security breaches but operates in an environment where most colleagues do not emphasize security, it is likely that the security posture is weaker collectively.
