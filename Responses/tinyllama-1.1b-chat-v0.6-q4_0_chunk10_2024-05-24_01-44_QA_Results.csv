The cognitive behavioral constructs in Amelia Perez's or James Jackson's cognition are motivation and attitude.

In terms of intent and subjective norms, employees who perceive that they have a direct impact on the success of the organization may be more likely to take action to safeguard company data and assets.

It evaluates whether they intend to carry out their intended action or not. Based on the statement of Liam Rodriguez, it seems he has high intentions and carries out his planned actions with the expectation that they will be carried out successfully. However, given his lack of security knowledge and awareness, it is likely that he is unaware of the potential risks associated with cyber attacks and may not have taken the necessary precautions to protect sensitive data.

Option b: Threat severity refers to how severe the threat is perceived by the individual or their organization. For example, if the threat is relatively high or extremely high, it may be considered a high-level concern. In this case, Liam Rodriguez's intentions may have been too low and may not have been as determined to safeguard the sensitive assets of their organization.

Option c: Vulnerability refers to the individual's perception of how easy it is for others to access or exploit them, even if they take basic precautions to secure their data. This construct evaluates whether the individual has vulnerabilities that allow attackers to easily gain access and steal sensitive information. For Liam Rodriguez, the potential risk from cyber threats was considered low and he expressed his intention of safeguarding their organization's assets.

Option d: Social norms refers to the expectation or expectation of behavior among others based on societal norms, such as expectations or cultural norms. This construct evaluates whether the individual has expectations that are different from those of others in their social group, which may affect their ability to secure sensitive data. In this case, Liam Rodriguez's lack of security knowledge and awareness could have impacted his intentions to safeguard the sensitive assets of their organization.

Option a: Intent is an important construct that helps individuals evaluate the nature and consequences of their intended actions and make informed decisions about how best to carry them out. Highly intentional individuals may be more likely to take steps to safeguard their data, such as using security technologies or following protocols for information security. Conversely, low-intent individuals may not be as determined to safeguard their data and may lack the knowledge and awareness needed to carry out their intended actions effectively.

Option b: Threat severity refers to how severe the threat is perceived by the individual or their organization. For example, if a threat is relatively high or extremely high, it may be considered a high-level concern. High-threat individuals may be more likely to take precautions and may have high levels of awareness and knowledge about information security risks.

Option c: Vulnerability refers to the individual's perception of how easy it is for others to access or exploit them, even if they take basic precautions to secure their data. For example, a vulnerable person may be more likely to lose their devices, lose their internet connection, or compromise their access due to lack of awareness or knowledge about information security risks.

Option d: Social norms refers to the expectation or expectation of behavior among others based on societal norms, such as expectations or cultural norms. For example, a high-risk individual may have unrealistic expectations regarding cybersecurity awareness and lack the necessary knowledge to safeguard their organization's data effectively.

In conclusion, Liam Rodriguez demonstrated low intentions towards protecting their sensitive assets of their organization while neglecting their social norms of not taking security precautions.
