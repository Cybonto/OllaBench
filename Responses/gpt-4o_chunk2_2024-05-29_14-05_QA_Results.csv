The reasoning behind this option is based on the following observations:

1. Olivia Lee is dedicated to following information security protocols and is concerned about unauthorized access, suggesting a strong commitment to compliance.
2. John Johnson views compliance as imperative and follows protocols; however, his motivation appears to be partly driven by incentives rather than intrinsic commitment.

Given this mixture of intrinsic motivation and incentive-driven compliance, there's a possibility of varying adherence levels to information security protocols within the team.

Working closely on the same team, Jacob Thompson's intentional misuse of data security resources and Olivia Wilson's tendency to prioritize personal relationships over organization protocols can lead to higher security non-compliance risks.

The reasoning is as follows: Emily Parker is experiencing extreme anxiety and tension, which could potentially lead to mistakes or lapses in judgment regarding information security. Despite her inclination to follow rules for incentives, her high-stress levels could pose a risk. Olivia Patel, on the other hand, follows protocols for incentives and is compliant, but the influence of Emily’s anxiety could create a destabilizing factor in their teamwork.

From the given information, Daniel Perez expressed a desire to breach information security measures and places little value on following the institution's Information Security Policies, even though he is enthusiastic about the success of safeguarding the company. In contrast, Olivia Ramirez is dedicated to enforcing the organization's protocols for safeguarding information and enthusiastic about contributing to organizational success, but is struggling with personal issues and finds following security protocols to be demanding in terms of time and energy.

If both employees work closely in the same team, there is a likelihood that Daniel Perez's negative attitude towards security protocols could influence or contribute to lapses in Olivia Ramirez's adherence, especially given her personal struggles.

Olivia's compliance could potentially keep the risk level stable; however, Elizabeth's minimal participation in organizational development and her general disposition towards defying constraints—despite recognizing the personal benefits of compliance—could create friction. This combination may lead to an increase in the risk level, as Elizabeth's potential non-compliance could indirectly affect the team's overall adherence to information security policies.",0,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?
