When employees with different attitudes towards information security work closely together, there is a potential for the security non-compliance risk level to increase. This is because:

1. Collaboration: If Emma Jones and Ethan Kim are collaborating on a project, they might influence each other's behaviors regarding information security. Ethan Kim's tendency to prioritize convenience over following security protocols could rub off on Emma Jones, or vice versa.
2. Complacency: The presence of one employee who disregards security policies may lead the other employee to become complacent about their own adherence to security measures. They might think that since the other person is not following the policies, it's acceptable for them to do so as well.
3. Lack of oversight: If both employees are not strictly following the organization's data protection protocols, there may be a lack of oversight and enforcement within their team, increasing the risk of non-compliance.
4. Compromised security measures: If Ethan Kim is using information security resources improperly, this could lead to compromised security measures, which might encourage Emma Jones to do the same in order to keep up with her colleague or to find workarounds to complete tasks.

However, it's essential to note that this is not a definitive answer, as the outcome depends on various factors such as the team culture, management supervision, and individual accountability.

When employees with different approaches to information security work closely together, it can create a situation where the risk of non-compliance may increase. This is because differences in perspectives and adherence to rules can lead to misunderstandings or conflicts when implementing security policies and procedures. While Sophia Lee seems to have a more stringent approach, Olivia Garcia appears to be more adaptive to societal norms and guidelines. 

Working closely together might create opportunities for them to learn from each other's perspectives, potentially improving the overall security posture of their team. However, it is also possible that these differences could lead to misunderstandings or disagreements when enforcing policies or making security-related decisions. This could result in a higher risk of non-compliance if not managed effectively.

To increase information security compliance, the cognitive behavioral factor that should be targeted for strengthening is motivation. When individuals are motivated to follow information security policies and procedures, they will be more likely to take appropriate actions to safeguard their organization's data and IT resources. This can be achieved through clear communication of the benefits of following these policies, as well as the potential consequences of not doing so. In the case of Olivia White, focusing on the power individuals have to protect themselves from cyber threats and emphasizing the benefits of doing so may increase their motivation to adhere to information security policies.

Targeting vulnerability as a cognitive behavioral factor for increasing information security compliance would involve understanding the individual's susceptibility to cyber threats and helping them identify areas where they may be vulnerable.

Sophia Richardson seems to have a strong belief in following rules and protocols, valuing relationships, and seeing rules as necessary for a functioning society. This aligns with the cognitive behavioral construct of subjective norms and group norms, which influence her intent and attitude towards following institutional policies. Her self-efficacy is also evident in her ability to utilize cybersecurity defense software effectively, although she may struggle to maintain proper safeguards.

Lily Thompson's intent to misuse organizational information security resources indicates a different cognitive behavioral construct. She may have a high belief in equitable competition within the organization but lacks self-efficacy in maintaining proper cybersecurity safeguards, which could lead to vulnerability in the institution's systems. Her attitude towards following Information Security Policies is negative, and she seems to prioritize her own interests over institutional guidelines.",0,"Who is MORE compliant with information security policies?

Explanation: Both Olivia Parker and Chloe Davis are showing cognitive behavioral constructs related to subjective norms, group norms, knowledge, self-efficacy, and moral. 

Subjective Norms: The individual mentioned their supervisors' belief in compliance with company regulations (Olivia Parker) and the influential connections insisting on following security measures (Chloe Davis). This shows that both individuals are influenced by the expectations of others.

Group Norms: Both statements mention adherence to company guidelines, highlighting the importance of following group norms within their organizations.

Knowledge: Olivia Parker's statement about unfair competition implies knowledge about industry practices, while Chloe Davis's reference to strict rules for utilizing computer resources suggests an understanding of company policies and procedures.

Self-Efficacy: Both individuals demonstrate a commitment to ensuring data safety and security within their respective companies, showcasing a belief in their ability to carry out these tasks effectively.

Combining the two individuals' perspectives and beliefs on security may lead to either a more comprehensive understanding of information security or potential conflicts in how they approach compliance. Since Olivia Parker believes that implementing security technologies is necessary, but also admits their organization engages in unfair competition, there could be an increased risk of non-compliance if they prioritize the organization's competitive advantage over following established security policies.

On the other hand, Chloe Davis sees following Information Security Policies as mandatory and plans to ensure the safety of data and technology within their company. However, this focus on strict rules for utilizing computer resources could potentially clash with Olivia Parker's approach if they prioritize efficiency or convenience over adhering to these rules.

However, Sophia expresses a sense of vulnerability and risk if someone else discovers her password, while Alexandra emphasizes the importance of following rules and complies with the organization's Information Security Policies.

To improve overall compliance, it would be crucial to address and strengthen the belief in the necessity and effectiveness of information security measures among all employees within the organization. This can be achieved through regular training, clear communication about the potential consequences of data breaches or cyberattacks, and demonstrating a commitment to information security from management levels down. By promoting a shared belief in the importance of information security, organizations can foster a culture of compliance that will ultimately help protect their confidential data and technological assets.",0,2

Explanation: Olivia Smith and Anna Davis' cognitive behavioral constructs can be best understood using the Social Cognitive Theory, which includes the following factors: Norms, Goal, Attitude, Response Efficacy, and Commitment. 

Olivia Smith seems to follow the institution's Information Security Policies as mandatory because she views compliance with the company's safety protocols as obligatory. This indicates her adherence to social norms, which is the first factor in the Social Cognitive Theory.

Anna Davis, on the other hand, appears confused about workplace regulations and might purposely break security guidelines for personal benefit. This shows a lack of commitment and understanding of organizational norms. However, she can easily operate cybersecurity defense technology and utilize security software to protect her information. This indicates high response efficacy, which is another factor in the Social Cognitive Theory.

Both Olivia and Anna have specific goals (following company policies, protecting their own information), attitudes (obligatory compliance, confusion about norms), and might face different costs or benefits based on their actions (risk of data breaches, potential penalties). These factors are also included in the Social Cognitive Theory.

Targeting subjective norms can be effective in increasing information security compliance because it focuses on the individual's perception of what others, particularly those they respect or admire, would approve or disapprove of their actions. By influencing these perceptions, organizations can encourage individuals to adhere to information security policies and best practices, as they believe that their peers, supervisors, or other influential figures in the organization expect them to do so. This approach aligns with the theory of planned behavior, which states that an individual's intention to perform a behavior is influenced by their attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control.[1]
