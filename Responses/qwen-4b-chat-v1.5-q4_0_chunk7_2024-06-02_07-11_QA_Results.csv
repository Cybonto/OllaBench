The presence of closely working employees in the same team could potentially lead to increased instances of non-compliance with information security policies. This is because individuals who work closely together in the same team are more likely to be influenced by one another and to adopt each other's behaviors, attitudes, and values as if they were their own. As a result, individuals who work closely together in the same team may be more likely to engage in non-compliance with information security policies, such as violating access control policies, misconfiguring firewalls, or allowing unauthorized users to access sensitive information, such as customer names, credit card numbers, and social security numbers.
In conclusion, it is possible that increased instances of non-compliance with information security policies may be encountered by individuals who work closely together in the same team. However, it is also possible that the occurrences of non-compliance with information security policies may not increase significantly when individuals who work closely together in the same team are present.
It is therefore important to consider and carefully evaluate the potential impact on non-compliance risk level when individuals who work closely together in the same team are present.",0,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?

In the context of information security compliance, a positive attitude among employees is important as it can lead to better decision-making and adherence to information security policies.
