Olivia Rodriguez seems to prioritize following information security policies and understanding the potential consequences of not doing so. This suggests that her cognitive behavioral constructs align with the components of the Theory of Planned Behavior, such as attitude (toward following the policies), motivation (dedication to adhering to them), goal (to maintain a secure environment), belief (in the effectiveness of the policies), and knowledge (of the established protocols).

Emily Baker, on the other hand, seems less focused on following information security policies. This could be due to a lack of understanding or motivation to follow the rules. Her cognitive behavioral constructs may include attitude (toward rule-following), costs (potential harm to relationships for not following them), norms (thinking that rules should be obeyed), goal (to maintain good relationships), and self-efficacy (the belief in one's ability to follow the policies).

Working closely in the same team may lead to a higher risk of security non-compliance for several reasons:

1. Cross-contamination of behaviors: If one employee is not following security policies, it can influence or encourage others to do the same. This behavioral contagion can increase the likelihood of non-compliance within the team.
2. Increased access and exposure: When working closely together, employees may have increased access to each other's data and systems, which could lead to accidental or intentional misuse or exposure of sensitive information.
3. Trust and accountability issues: If one employee is not trustworthy or accountable, it can create a sense of distrust among the team members. This lack of trust may result in employees being less likely to report security incidents or non-compliance, further increasing the risk.
4. Compromised policies and procedures: A security policy that works well for one employee might not be suitable for another, especially if they have different roles within the organization. Working closely together could lead to compromises in the established policies and procedures, which can increase the risk of non-compliance.",1,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?

This option best reflects the cognitive behavioral constructs of John Williams and Emily Parker as it includes the most relevant factors that influence their attitudes towards information security policies. 

John Williams, in this case, seems to have a higher threat severity perception about his organization's security resources being misused. This could lead to him having a negative attitude towards following security guidelines due to the perceived risks. His intent is not clear from the given information but it can be inferred that he may disregard security policies for his own benefit, which indicates a potential malicious intent. He also believes that others accessing his password would put his account at risk, showing self-efficacy beliefs about maintaining personal security.

On the other hand, Emily Parker appears to have a lower threat severity perception as she trusts regulations are designed to be followed and that disciplinary action will deter violations. She has an intent to safeguard her company's digital assets but may face challenges in implementing this due to subjective norms of non-compliance within her division. Her attitude seems more positive towards security policies as she believes the organization should adopt security technologies. This indicates a potential for self-efficacy and motivation to change existing policies if given the opportunity.

Justification: The given intelligence about Sophia Jackson and Emily Anderson reflect their cognitions related to IT security, including their knowledge of policies, their attitudes towards security measures, and their beliefs in the effectiveness of preventive measures. These aspects are closely aligned with the Theory of Planned Behavior (ToPB) constructs. 

Sophia Jackson seems to have a high level of self-efficacy as she follows rules to receive incentives and values institutional policies. She is also concerned about potential data breaches, showing that she perceives IT security threats as severe. Her comments about specific rules for using computer resources indicate her knowledge about the organization's policy. The statement reflects her response efficacy because she seems to believe that compliance with the policies can prevent negative consequences or breaches.

Emily Anderson also appears knowledgeable about policy breaches and their repercussions, showing her awareness of IT security issues in the organization. She advocates for increased security measures, suggesting a high level of control over the situation. Like Sophia Jackson, she perceives threats as severe and understands response efficacy through compliance with the information security protocols. Her skepticism about preventive measures' effectiveness indicates her knowledge about the limitations of IT security solutions. 

Therefore, both cases align well with the Theory of Planned Behavior model, which includes self-efficacy, knowledge, control, threat severity, and response efficacy as key cognitive constructs that influence behavioral intentions and ultimately, behaviors.",0,"Who is MORE compliant with information security policies?
