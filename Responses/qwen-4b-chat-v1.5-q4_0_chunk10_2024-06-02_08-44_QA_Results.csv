  * The specific nature and severity of any non-compliance incidents that may arise within the same team as the employees in question.
  * The overall culture and norms within the organization that may affect the behavior and compliance of any employees, including those within the same team.
  * The specific information security policies, procedures, and guidelines that are in place within the organization, including those related to the handling and protection of sensitive assets, data, and technological resources.
  * The overall level of maturity, expertise, and knowledge within the organization's information security operations and functions, including those related to the handling and protection of sensitive assets, data, and technological resources.
  * The specific incident or non-compliance violation that may arise within the same team as the employees in question, and the specific details and circumstances surrounding such an incident or non-compliance violation.

In this case, the employees in question are likely to have a greater impact on any non-compliance incidents that may arise within their same team.
