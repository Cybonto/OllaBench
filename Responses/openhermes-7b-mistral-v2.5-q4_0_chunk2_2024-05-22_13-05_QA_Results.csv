Given the information provided, it is difficult to determine with certainty whether the security non-compliance risk level will increase if Ethan Price and David Garcia work closely in the same team. Both individuals seem dedicated to contributing to the success of their organization's information security, but they have differing approaches and levels of compliance knowledge.

Ethan Price appears to have a good understanding of the importance of following information security policies and is committed to adhering to those policies. However, they may not be properly trained in compliance procedures for their job. If they were to work closely with David Garcia, who intends to intentionally violate company information security protocols, there could be a risk of influence or pressure on Ethan Price to adopt similar non-compliant behaviors.

On the other hand, David Garcia's intentions to deliberately violate information security policies may lead him to find ways to bypass or exploit the policies. If he were to work closely with Ethan Price, who follows the policies and is committed to maintaining compliance, there could be a risk of David Garcia influencing Ethan Price or finding vulnerabilities in the organization's information security through their collaboration.

Overall, working together may lead to increased communication and potentially new perspectives on information security, but it also introduces the possibility of increased non-compliance risk if one employee's intentions clash with the other's approach to information security.",1,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?

Working closely in the same team could lead to a higher security non-compliance risk level because of potential conflicts between their different approaches to information security. Alexander Kim's concern for compliance and adherence to Information Security Policies combined with Benjamin Chang's lack of understanding or awareness of these policies could create tension or confusion within the team. This may lead to miscommunication, misunderstandings, or even deliberate non-compliance as one party seeks to impose their perspective on information security onto the other.

Daniel Kim's case is characterized by a desire to protect his employer's information, compliance with company policies, and the ability to ignore those policies when it suits him. This suggests that he has some level of self-efficacy (belief in his ability to manage security) but may also show vulnerability (potentially choosing personal gain over company protection). He demonstrates knowledge of the company's rules but does not seem to prioritize them consistently, suggesting a potential lack of response efficacy. His comments about ignoring policies could also indicate a sense of control over his actions, though this might be misplaced in some cases.

Jacob Martinez, on the other hand, seems to value following information security policies as a crucial responsibility and acknowledges the consequences of his carelessness. This suggests he has high self-efficacy, showing knowledge about how to safeguard himself and others against breaches. His comments might be interpreted as humor or sarcasm regarding intentionally misusing security resources in the organization. He also shows control over his behavior by being able to use cybersecurity protection software easily. However, without more context, it's difficult to assess vulnerability or response efficacy.

Explanation: Working closely in the same team might lead to a higher risk of information security non-compliance, as the employees could potentially influence each other's behavior. Emma Perez values compliance and following safety measures, while Emma Roberts prioritizes adherence to Information Security Policies.

Targeting the cognitive behavioral factor of control can help increase information security compliance. By emphasizing the individual's ability to influence and shape their own environment, they become more empowered and likely to follow established security policies. This approach is supported by the social cognitive theory and self-efficacy theory, which suggest that people are more likely to perform a behavior when they believe they have control over it.

To implement this strategy, organizations can provide training and resources that emphasize the individual's control over their own information security actions. This could include providing clear guidelines for proper computer usage, educating employees about cybersecurity best practices, and offering incentives for following established security policies. Additionally, managers can encourage open communication between employees and IT staff to ensure everyone feels they have a voice in maintaining organizational security.

Working closely in the same team may lead to an increased risk of information security non-compliance for several reasons. Firstly, when employees with different levels of compliance awareness work together, there is a possibility that they may influence each other's behaviors. For example, Christopher Brown's inclination towards abusing information security may rub off on Alexander Cooper or vice versa. This could potentially lead to non-compliance with information security policies.

Secondly, when employees work closely together, there is an increased chance of sharing sensitive information unintentionally. For instance, if Christopher Brown has a poor understanding of information security, he might inadvertently share confidential data with Alexander Cooper, who follows the policies diligently. This could result in non-compliance issues.

Lastly, working closely together may create an environment where employees are less vigilant about following security protocols due to familiarity or trust within the team. In such a situation, there is an increased risk of non-compliance with information security policies.

However, it is essential to note that this outcome is not certain and depends on various factors like team culture, management oversight, and individual accountability.
