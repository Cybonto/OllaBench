Mary Johnson's cognitive behavioral constructs seem to align with this option, as she seems to be aware of the costs associated with violating information security protocols and the importance of enforcing these policies within her organization. She also values safeguarding company data and technology assets. This indicates that Mary has a strong belief in the necessity of following such protocols for the success of the organization, which is reflected in her attitude towards information security.

Olivia Nguyen appears to have a lax attitude towards security protocols, as indicated by her statement that some individuals in her department believe they are above following security protocols. This suggests that group norms and personal motivation may be influencing her behavior. Furthermore, her comment about fearing being judged by colleagues implies that subjective norms play a role in her decision-making process. The benefits of adhering to security policies are likely minimal in Olivia's department, as the statement mentions the adherence to information security policies is minimal within the person's department.

On the other hand, Emily Jones appears to have a strong motivation for complying with security procedures and values following rules within her institution. She also acknowledges the potential vulnerability of her password. This suggests that her attitude, subjective norms, and knowledge contribute to her positive approach towards information security. The benefits of adhering to security policies are likely significant in Emily's department, as she believes security technologies help safeguard sensitive data.

In summary, both individuals have different cognitive behavioral constructs regarding information security. Olivia Nguyen's behavior is influenced by group norms, subjective norms, and the minimal perceived benefits of following security protocols, while Emily Jones's behavior is driven by her attitude, knowledge, subjective norms, and the significant benefits of adhering to security policies in her department.",0,"Who is MORE compliant with information security policies?

Working closely in the same team could potentially lead to an increased risk of security non-compliance for a few reasons. First, if Olivia Nguyen's department values disregard for information security policies, and Emily Jones is working closely with them, there may be peer pressure to follow their example. Secondly, having access to sensitive data from multiple sources can create opportunities for unintentional or intentional misuse. Additionally, if the team members have differing attitudes towards compliance, this could lead to a lack of standardization in security practices, making it more difficult to maintain a secure environment.

Explanation: The cognitive behavioral construct model that best reflects Olivia Wilson's and Tyler Jenkins's thinking is the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), which includes subjective norms, threat severity, social, commitment, and intent as its main components. This model explains how individuals form their attitudes towards a potential threat, such as cybersecurity threats, and determine whether or not to engage in protective actions (in this case, adhering to safety protocols and expressing concern for the organization's information security).

In Olivia Wilson's case, she actively promotes involvement in information security policies within the organization, indicating a commitment to protect against cyber threats. Tyler Jenkins displays a positive attitude and strong work ethic, believing his company has ethical business practices. Both individuals perceive their company's information and technology assets as important and have intentions to follow safety protocols. This aligns with the PMT model, which includes subjective norms (attitudes towards the organization), threat severity (perception of the risk posed by cyber threats), social influences (the individual's involvement in promoting information security policies), commitment (belief in the importance of safeguarding organizational assets), and intent (the decision to engage in protective actions).",0,"Who is LESS compliant with information security policies?

Ethan Rivera's statement shows a focus on goals related to following security procedures and valuing adherence to company policies.

She believes that breaking rules is justified if it contributes to company progress. This shows a goal-oriented attitude that can be linked to 'Attitude'. Her active participation in efforts for the company's progress aligns with 'Control'.

To increase information security compliance, it is crucial to target the cognitive behavioral factor of norms. This involves reinforcing the shared beliefs and values within an organization that emphasize the importance of following security policies and procedures. By making sure that the majority of individuals within the organization support and adhere to these norms, it creates a culture of security awareness and encourages others to follow suit. This approach is more effective than simply providing knowledge or focusing on individual intent, as it takes into account the social influence and group dynamics that can impact compliance with security measures.\n\nIn the case of Brandon Rodriguez, targeting the norms would involve emphasizing the importance of following security policies to protect not only their own data but also that of their colleagues. This could be achieved through regular training, clear communication from management about the organization's commitment to security, and incorporating security procedures into daily work routines.\n\nFor Abigail Park, targeting the norms would involve helping her understand the importance of obedience in the context of information security and reinforcing the shared belief that protecting information is necessary for the organization's success. This could be done through group discussions, case studies, or role-playing exercises that demonstrate the consequences of not following security policies.\n\nIn both cases, targeting the norms would help create a culture where information security compliance becomes a shared responsibility and a fundamental aspect of the organization's values and practices.",0,1

By influencing an individual's perception of their peers' beliefs and expectations regarding information security compliance, it can lead to a greater sense of obligation and motivation to adhere to the established policies and procedures.\n
Enhancing subjective norms can be achieved through various methods such as promoting a culture of information security within the organization, encouraging open communication about the importance of compliance, and providing examples of successful implementation from other organizations. By doing so, individuals will be more likely to prioritize information security within their work responsibilities and contribute positively to overall organizational security.\n
Intent, threat severity, and affect can also play a role in influencing an individual's behavior; however, targeting subjective norms specifically addresses the social aspect of compliance and encourages individuals to align their actions with what they perceive others expect from them. This approach has been proven effective in fostering long-term behavior change and increased adherence to organizational policies and procedures.\n
In the context of Ava Garcia's and Jack Murphy's statements, both appear to have a strong sense of subjective norms regarding information security compliance, as they are aware of their organization's expectations and prioritize following established protocols.

Increasing information security compliance would be most effective by targeting the cognitive behavioral factor of group norms.

This approach will not only address the individual's rebellious nature but also create a sense of collective responsibility for maintaining information security.\n\nTargeting moral (option b) may help in some cases, as Ethan Davis shows integrity and ethics towards competition, but it might not be sufficient to influence those who disregard societal norms.

Self-efficacy refers to an individual's belief in their ability to successfully perform a task or achieve a specific goal. In the context of information security, self-efficacy would involve an employee's confidence in their ability to follow cybersecurity policies, identify potential threats, and respond appropriately.
