Another factor is attitude. Individuals who have a positive attitude towards cybersecurity can be more inclined to adopt proactive measures that increase information security compliance.

2. Enforcement of security protocols: Regulatory agencies should enforce strict penalties for employees who violate information security regulations. For instance, in the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has imposed fines up to $1 million on companies that fail to comply with securities laws.

3. Encouraging staff to report suspicious activities: Encourage your employees to report any suspicious activity they may encounter in their workplace. This will help identify potential security breaches, and the organizational leaders can take appropriate steps to address them promptly.

4. Ensuring secure communication channels: Use secure communication channels such as encrypted messaging apps to ensure that all critical information is transmitted securely. Encryption is an effective way to protect sensitive data and avoid unauthorized access.

5. Training and education programs: Provide regular training and education programs to employees on how to protect their work environment and personal devices. This will help them identify potential threats, implement security measures, and become more aware of their role in ensuring the organization's information is protected.

This can be due to several reasons, including:

1. Trust Issues: If there are trust issues between coworkers or if one of the individuals has an aggressive or unethical behavior towards their colleagues, they may try to exploit vulnerabilities in their team or engage in other forms of malicious activity to gain an unfair advantage.

2. Competition for Resources: If there is a strong competition among coworkers for resources like tech assets or data, it could increase the risk of security non-compliance as they may attempt to exploit opportunities for themselves.

3. Intrinsic Motivation: The motivations and desires of individuals in a team environment are often more personal than professional, and thus, intrinsic motivation could be a contributing factor in why the individual would choose to engage in security non-compliance. For example, an individual may feel that taking advantage of resources for their own gain is a way to advance their career or reputation within the organization.

4. Challenges and Complexity: While collaboration can bring benefits to both individuals, it also introduces complexities into cybersecurity protocols and measures that could cause non-compliance. For example, if one of the colleagues has access to sensitive information that is not shared among team members or if there are no standardized procedures in place for secure communication, these factors could lead to potential risks.
