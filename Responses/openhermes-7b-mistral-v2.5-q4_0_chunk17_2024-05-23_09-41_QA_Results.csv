This is because subjective norms refer to an individual's perception of what others, particularly those they respect or look up to, would think about their behavior. By targeting subjective norms, you can influence employees to follow information security protocols by making them believe that their colleagues and supervisors support and encourage these practices. This could be done through various means such as promoting a strong culture of compliance within the organization, highlighting examples of successful implementation of information security policies, or even seeking endorsements from respected individuals within the company.\n\nSubjective norms can also be influenced by peer pressure, social norms, and group dynamics. By creating an environment where following information security protocols is seen as a norm and not deviating from these protocols is seen as unusual or wrong, employees are more likely to adhere to the policies in place.\n\nThe other cognitive behavioral factors, such as belief, costs, and norms, can also play important roles in information security compliance. However, targeting subjective norms is a good starting point as it addresses the social aspect of compliance and is likely to have a wider impact across different departments and levels within an organization.\n\nIt's also important to note that any approach to increasing information security compliance should be holistic and include addressing other factors as well, such as providing adequate training on information security policies and procedures, ensuring the policies are clear and easy to understand, and making it easier for employees to report instances of non-compliance without fear of retribution.\n\nIn conclusion, targeting subjective norms is a good starting point to increase information security compliance in an organization. However, it should be combined with other strategies that address the other cognitive behavioral factors to ensure long-term success and effective implementation of information security policies.\n

Expert Comment:

""Targeting subjective norms can have a strong influence on employee behavior when it comes to information security compliance. By making employees believe that their peers and supervisors support these practices, they are more likely to follow the protocols. This should be combined with other strategies that address the other cognitive behavioral factors such as providing training and ensuring policies are easy to understand.""",0,2

However, attitude remains the most crucial cognitive behavioral factor to target for strengthening information security compliance within an organization.\n\nGoals and threat severity are important considerations but cannot be directly targeted as cognitive behavioral factors to improve information security compliance. Instead, they should be incorporated into a comprehensive approach that includes addressing attitudes and social factors to create a secure work environment.\n\nIn summary, focusing on (option a) - Attitude is the best way to strengthen information security compliance within an organization.\",1,2

When Alexander Patel and Olivia Green work closely in the same team, the security non-compliance risk level may increase due to the following reasons:

1. Human Error: With two individuals working together on tasks that involve sensitive information, there is a possibility of human error leading to a breach or violation of the organization's Information Security Policies. This could occur if one person forgets to follow a protocol, and the other person isn't trained or aware of the specific policy, leading to non-compliance.

2. Social Engineering: Alexander Patel mentioned that important login information is stolen can have serious repercussions. If Olivia Green is not adequately trained in identifying phishing attempts or social engineering tactics, she may unknowingly compromise sensitive information. This would result in a security breach and non-compliance with the organization's policies.

3. Trust: Both Alexander Patel and Olivia Green value compliance with their organization's Information Security Policies. However, when working closely together, they might be inclined to take shortcuts or deviate from the established procedures in an attempt to save time or meet tight deadlines. This could lead to a lapse in security measures and non-compliance with organizational policies.

As both Olivia Lopez and Elizabeth Nguyen express different attitudes towards their organization's Information Security Policies, working closely in the same team may lead to a potential increase in security non-compliance risk level.

On the other hand, Elizabeth Nguyen disregards the institution's policies as trivial and may not follow them properly. Combining their different attitudes within the same team could potentially lead to a lack of adherence to security protocols, increasing the risk level. However, it is also possible that their differing perspectives could lead to productive discussions and improved compliance if effectively managed and channeled towards better policies and practices.",1,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?

Working closely together in the same team could potentially lead to an increased risk of non-compliance with information security protocols. While it is not guaranteed that this will happen, there are several factors to consider that could contribute to a higher risk level:

1. Potential lack of diverse perspectives: If both employees come from similar backgrounds or have similar experiences, they may not be aware of all the potential risks and vulnerabilities that could arise.
2. Groupthink: When working closely together in a team, it can sometimes lead to groupthink, where individuals may feel pressure to conform to the majority opinion rather than questioning or challenging each other's assumptions or practices. This could result in complacency regarding information security protocols.
3. Overreliance on trust: While trust is crucial in any team, relying solely on trust can lead to oversights or neglecting to follow established procedures.
4. Shared access privileges: If both employees have access to the same sensitive information or systems, there is a higher risk of accidental or intentional non-compliance with security protocols.

While both Daniel Rodriguez and Ethan Miller appear to be committed to information security, working closely together in the same team could potentially introduce new risks or challenges that could lead to a higher non-compliance risk level. For example, they might have different approaches to security policies, or one employee's strengths in a particular area may compensate for the other's weaknesses, leading to a false sense of security. Additionally, working closely together could result in increased opportunities for insider threats if one employee decides to compromise security measures.

By fostering a positive and proactive attitude towards information security, employees are more likely to actively engage in following protocols and taking necessary precautions. This can involve focusing on cultivating a culture of awareness, accountability, and responsibility regarding information security within the organization.

In Julia Rodriguez's case, her dedication to enforcing and advocating for the organization's security protocols and adherence to safety protocols align with a positive attitude towards information security. Targeting this cognitive behavioral factor can help strengthen her existing commitment to these efforts.

Similarly, Elijah Parker's willingness to follow rules and morals over taking advantage of loopholes, along with his desire to advance the organization's information security protocols, also suggests a positive attitude towards information security. Strengthening this cognitive behavioral factor can further enhance their compliance efforts.",0,2

If these employees were to work closely together on a team, it is possible that their differing perspectives on security could create conflicts or gaps in the overall security approach taken by the team. Additionally, Anderson's lack of knowledge about relevant regulations could potentially lead to non-compliance issues if left unchecked.
