Adam Thompson's cognitive behavioral constructs would likely be: (option a) Response Efficacy, Attitude, Vulnerability, Costs, Belief. He values honesty and integrity over convenience but disregards following the institution's security policies, indicating a lack of response efficacy. His attitude towards the organization's security policies is negative, which suggests a vulnerability to noncompliance. The potential consequences of noncompliance with information security policies represent costs that Adam may weigh against the inconvenience of compliance. Finally, his belief about the futility of following the institution's information security policies reflects a cognitive bias that may further exacerbate his vulnerability.

Peter Davis's cognitive behavioral constructs would likely be: (option b) Control, Motivation, Attitude, Subjective norms, Belief.

However, we can analyze the given intelligence for each individual:

For Emily Nguyen:

* She may compromise security measures to satisfy her superior's desires.
* She disregards the importance of following the institution's Information Security Policies.
* She effortlessly employs cybersecurity software to safeguard her system.

Based on this information, we can infer that Emily Nguyen may have a negative attitude towards following information security policies and may prioritize other interests over adhering to these policies. Her behavior suggests that she recognizes the importance of employing cybersecurity software but does not fully embrace the institution's Information Security Policies.

For Olivia Rodriguez:

* She sees following information security policies as imperative.
* She expressed a desire to safeguard her organization's data and technology assets.
* She can efficiently operate cybersecurity protection software with minimal difficulty.

Based on this information, we can infer that Olivia Rodriguez has a positive attitude towards following information security policies and recognizes the importance of protecting her organization's data and technology assets. Her behavior suggests that she is self-efficient in operating cybersecurity protection software.

In summary, while we cannot definitively select one option from those provided, it seems that Emily Nguyen may exhibit characteristics of 'Response Efficacy' (the belief in one's ability to perform a behavior or task) and Olivia Rodriguez may exhibit characteristics of 'Self-efficacy' (the belief in one's ability to perform a behavior or task) and 'Attitude' (a person's evaluation of a behavior, object, or situation).",0,"Who is MORE compliant with information security policies?

Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine with certainty whether the security non-compliance risk level will increase if Emily Nguyen and Olivia Rodriguez work closely in the same team. However, I would choose option (d) - security non-compliance risk level will increase as a possibility due to the following reasons:

Emily Nguyen has been reported to compromise security measures to satisfy their superior's desires and disregard the importance of following the institution's Information Security Policies. This behavior could potentially lead to a lack of adherence to established security protocols within the team, increasing the risk of non-compliance.

On the other hand, Olivia Rodriguez has expressed the importance of following information security policies and using modern security measures to maintain the confidentiality of important data. However, it is unclear if she can efficiently operate cybersecurity protection software with minimal difficulty, which could be crucial in ensuring proper security measures are taken within the team.

Considering these factors, it is plausible that the security non-compliance risk level may increase when Emily Nguyen and Olivia Rodriguez work closely in the same team. However, without additional information or context, it is impossible to make a definitive statement on this matter.",1,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?

Based on the information provided, it seems that the cognitive behavioral factor that should be targeted for strengthening in order to increase information security compliance is (option c) Attitude.

Attitude refers to an individual's evaluation of a particular object, person, or idea, and it can influence their behavior towards it. In this case, if the individual has a positive attitude towards following information security policies, they are more likely to adhere to them, which will increase compliance and overall security.

While Self-efficacy and Intent are also important factors in influencing behavior, Attitude is particularly relevant in this context as it indicates an individual's evaluation of the importance of following information security policies. Additionally, while Threat severity may be a factor in motivating individuals to adopt security measures, it does not directly address the cognitive process of evaluating the importance of complying with policies.",1,3

Furthermore, although she lacks familiarity with pertinent workplace rules and regulations, the fact that some people in the organization are concerned about the safety of information suggests that there is an overall focus on information security within the company.

Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that Emily Martinez may be less compliant with information security policies compared to Lily Miller.

* Takes the institution's Information Security Policies seriously and is dedicated to enforcing them.
* Can easily utilize cybersecurity protection tools.
* Expresses a commitment to safeguarding the assets of the organization.
* Has a strong moral obligation to follow rules and regulations related to information security.

Based on these observations, it seems that Caroline Clark's cognitive behavioral constructs are primarily related to motivation, commitment, self-efficacy, and intent. They suggest that Caroline is highly motivated to ensure the success of information security within the organization and has a strong sense of commitment to this goal. They also indicate that Caroline believes in her ability to utilize cybersecurity protection tools effectively (i.e., has high self-efficacy) and intends to follow through on her commitments related to information security.

Ethan Brown:

* Adheres to security regulations in order to receive benefits.
* Plans to intentionally misuse security resources at work.
* Believes their workplace has a strong culture of respect and equality.
* Sees following rules as a moral obligation.

Based on these observations, it seems that Ethan Brown's cognitive behavioral constructs are primarily related to motivation, commitment, social norms, response efficacy, and intent. They suggest that Ethan is motivated to adhere to security regulations in order to receive benefits (e.g., avoid punishment or gain access to resources). However, he also plans to intentionally misuse security resources at work, which suggests a conflicted attitude towards these regulations. Additionally, Ethan believes that his workplace has a strong culture of respect and equality, which could influence his motivation and commitment to following rules. Finally, Ethan sees following rules as a moral obligation, which could also impact his behavior related to information security.

Overall, based on the available information, option (a) - ['Subjective norms', 'Motivation', 'Commitment', 'Self-efficacy', 'Intent'] seems like the best fit for Caroline Clark's cognitive behavioral constructs, while option (b) - ['Social', 'Commitment', 'Response Efficacy', 'Intent', 'Commitment'] seems like a better fit for Ethan Brown's constructs.

Explanation:
Emily Smith's cognitive behavioral constructs are primarily focused on the social aspects of following information security policies. She values following the institution's Information Security Policies and taking part in initiatives aimed at promoting the organization's progress. There is a clear emphasis on the benefits of complying with security policies, which aligns with option (a). Additionally, Emily demonstrates knowledge of the security measures for her work computing resources.

Jack Wilson's cognitive behavioral constructs are focused on the social aspects of following information security policies, as well as the benefits and norms associated with compliance. Jack understands that following the information security policies would benefit him personally, and his circle also believes in adhering to the organization's security policy. Completing the information security compliance requirements would benefit him, and he has clearly explained his company's policies on computer usage. This aligns with option (a).",1,"Who is MORE compliant with information security policies? Your answer must begin with (option 
(option a) - Emily Smith
(option b) - They carry the same risk level
(option c) - It is impossible to tell
(option d) - Jack Wilson",(option d) - Jack Wilson,6111217470,190,"
Based on the provided information, it appears that Jack Wilson is more compliant with information security policies. The intelligence indicates that Jack understands the benefits of following information security policies and has a supportive circle that also believes in adhering to these policies. Additionally, Jack has explained their company's policies on computer usage clearly, which suggests that they have a good understanding of the organization's security requirements.

While Emily Smith is confident in the security measures for their work computing resources and places great value on following the institution's Information Security Policies, there is no explicit indication that she has actively contributed to the development of the organization or clearly explained the company's policies on computer usage like Jack Wilson has. Therefore, based on the available information, it seems that Jack Wilson is more compliant with information security policies than Emily Smith.

Option (d) - Jack Wilson",1,"Will information security non-compliance risk level increase if these employees work closely in the same team? Your answer must begin with (option 
(option a) - It is impossible to tell

(option c) - security non-compliance risk level will stay the same
(option d) - security non-compliance risk level will increase",(option b) - security non-compliance risk level may increase,7562966459,236,"
Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine with certainty whether the security non-compliance risk level will increase if Emily Smith and Jack Wilson work closely in the same team. However, there are some indicators that suggest that the risk may increase. These include:

* Both individuals have demonstrated a good understanding of the importance of following information security policies, but it is unclear whether they consistently adhere to these policies in their daily work practices.
* Jack Wilson's circle believes in following the organization's security policy, which suggests that there may be some pressure on him to comply with the policies, and this pressure could potentially influence Emily Smith as well if they work closely together.

Therefore, while it is impossible to say for certain whether the risk level will increase, option (b) ""security non-compliance risk level may increase"" seems like a reasonable assumption based on the available information. It is important for the organization to provide adequate training and support to both employees to ensure that they are aware of the policies and have the knowledge and tools necessary to comply with them consistently.",0,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening? Your answer must begin with (option

To increase information security compliance, the cognitive behavioral factor that should be targeted for strengthening is (option d) Norms. This is because the intelligence report indicates that Jack Wilson's circle believes in following the organization's security policy and that completing the information security compliance requirements would benefit the individual. By emphasizing the importance of adhering to norms and expectations within the organization, it may encourage Jack Wilson and others to prioritize information security compliance.",0,2

For Lila Patel, her statement emphasizes the need for strong password protection and her ability to easily employ cybersecurity programs. These behaviors indicate a positive attitude towards information security and self-efficacy in implementing security measures. The potential compensation suggests a goal related to information security, while the mention of company protocols indicates awareness of costs associated with noncompliance.

For Emma Garcia, her statement expresses determination to safeguard her organization's information and technology assets, indicating a strong motivation for information security. The fact that her colleagues would not condone misuse of information security resources suggests a collective attitude towards the importance of security. Following institutional policies is viewed as mandatory, which implies knowledge of benefits and threat severity associated with noncompliance.

Explanation:

Benjamin Brown's intelligence suggests that they value the institution's Information Security Policies and follow them carefully. They understand that implementing information security policies requires a significant investment of time and effort, but they are willing to make this investment in order to ensure the safety and security of the institution's information. Their motivation to maintain information security is driven by their desire to earn benefits, such as compensation or an apology, for the inconvenience caused by following safety measures. Additionally, they recognize that maintaining information security is their personal responsibility. Therefore, based on these factors, the cognitive behavioral constructs that best reflect Benjamin Brown's attitude towards information security are:

* Benefits: They believe that following information security policies will lead to benefits such as compensation or an apology.

* Motivation: Their motivation to follow information security policies is driven by a desire to earn benefits and their personal responsibility towards maintaining information security.
* Control: They recognize that they have control over implementing and following information security policies to safeguard against breaches.

Regarding Tyler Evans, the intelligence suggests that they lack regard for the institution's security policies and are more focused on their own ability to safeguard the business.

Based on the provided information about Andrew Diaz and Lily Davis, it seems that they have different attitudes towards following information security policies. While Andrew claims to engage in ethical competition with other organizations, he does not believe in implementing protection measures for information and may misuse resources. On the other hand, Lily is willing to follow rules and regulations and adhere to her organization's information security policy, even if it means sacrificing personal benefits or power.

Given these differences, it is possible that working closely together on a team could potentially increase the risk of non-compliance with information security policies. This is because Andrew may attempt to persuade Lily to adopt his views and engage in information security misuse, which would go against her principles and dedication to enforcing security procedures within the company.

Control refers to an individual's belief in their ability to influence events and situations. When individuals feel they have control over their environment and can make a difference in outcomes, they are more likely to engage in pro-social behavior and follow rules and regulations. In the case of information security compliance, individuals who feel they have control over their organization's security measures are more likely to adhere to these policies and procedures, which ultimately helps increase overall compliance.

Therefore, strengthening an individual's sense of control can be a powerful tool in promoting information security compliance within an organization.",0,0

Explanation:
Based on the provided information, Caleb Williams values following rules and believes in their importance. They also value their relationships above their organization's policies. In addition, they respect and value the institution's guidelines for keeping information safe. These factors suggest that Caleb has a positive intent towards complying with information security policies. However, it may be challenging for them to complete tasks in compliance with these protocols due to their struggles following necessary procedures for their job. Therefore, we can infer that Caleb's attitude towards complying with information security policies is influenced by both the benefits and costs associated with it.",1,"Who is MORE compliant with information security policies? Your answer must begin with (option 
(option a) - It is impossible to tell
(option b) - They carry the same risk level
(option c) - Caleb Williams
(option d) - Olivia Jones",(option c) - Caleb Williams,4108318547,122,"
It is difficult to determine who is more compliant with information security policies based on the given intelligence. Both individuals have stated their commitment to following the organization's information security policies, but Caleb Williams values relationships above organizational policies and may struggle with completing tasks in compliance with information security protocols. On the other hand, Olivia Jones sees following the institution's security policies as mandatory and struggles with following necessary procedures for their job.

Therefore, it is impossible to tell who is more compliant with information security policies based on this limited information.",1,"Will information security non-compliance risk level increase if these employees work closely in the same team? Your answer must begin with (option 
(option a) - It is impossible to tell
(option b) - security non-compliance risk level will increase
(option c) - security non-compliance risk level will stay the same
(option d) - security non-compliance risk level may increase",(option b) - security non-compliance risk level will increase,8702817323,251,"
In this scenario, the intelligence gathered about Caleb Williams and Olivia Jones suggests that their attitudes towards compliance with information security policies could be quite different. While Caleb values fair treatment of workers and follows rules, he also prioritizes his relationships over organizational policies. On the other hand, Olivia sees following the organization's information security policies as mandatory and may struggle to complete tasks that do not comply with these protocols.

Given these differences in attitude, it is possible that working closely together on a project could increase the risk of non-compliance with information security policies. While Caleb may be more likely to take shortcuts or overlook security protocols in order to maintain his relationships, Olivia's adherence to the organization's policies may conflict with this approach.

Therefore, the answer is (option d) - security non-compliance risk level may increase. It is impossible to say for certain what will happen without more information about the specific situation and the individuals involved. However, given their differing attitudes towards compliance, there is a possibility that working together could lead to an increased risk of non-compliance with information security policies.",0,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?

The cognitive behavioral factor that should be targeted for strengthening to increase information security compliance is (option b) - Attitude. The individual's attitude towards following the institution's security policies and procedures is crucial in determining their level of compliance. By strengthening their positive attitude towards compliance, it can help them see the importance of adhering to the policies and make it easier for them to follow the necessary steps to ensure information security.",1,3

In Emily Brown's case, while the department has a strong culture of compliance with information security policies, there may be individuals who lack understanding or self-efficacy to follow these policies. Therefore, strengthening self-efficacy can help such individuals believe in their ability to comply with the policies and follow them consistently.

In Benjamin Nguyen's case, while the individual is knowledgeable about the company's protocol breaches and repercussions, they may lack self-efficacy to implement cybersecurity measures effectively.

Olivia King's strong adherence to rules and responsibility for following their organization's security policies could positively impact Emily Rivera's understanding of legal requirements and the importance of following company security protocols.

However, it is also possible that if Emily Rivera remains unfamiliar with legal requirements and continues to be unaware of potential loopholes in the system, her principled approach might conflict with Olivia King's rigid adherence to rules. This could potentially lead to a higher risk of non-compliance due to misunderstandings or differing opinions on how to handle specific security situations.

For Matthew Thompson, option (b) - ['Attitude', 'Norms', 'Subjective norms', 'Knowledge', 'Costs'] best reflects his cognitive behavioral constructs.

Matthew Thompson stated that their company engages in fair competition with its rivals and plans to attempt unethical manipulation of sensitive resources in their company. The fact that he mentioned ""unethical manipulation"" suggests a negative attitude towards information security policies, which falls under the attitude construct. Furthermore, his statement indicates that there may be subjective norms within the organization regarding ethical behavior related to information security practices, suggesting the presence of 'Subjective norms'.

Additionally, Matthew Thompson's statement implies that he has knowledge about information security policies and practices in his company. Therefore, 'Knowledge' is included as a construct. Lastly, the fact that he plans to attempt unethical manipulation suggests that cost may not be a significant barrier for him when it comes to violating information security policies, thus 'Costs' is also an appropriate construct.",1,"Who is MORE compliant with information security policies?

Additionally, they mentioned low costs for implementing security policies, indicating a commitment to maintaining security measures.

On the other hand, while Matthew Thompson stated that his company engages in fair competition with its rivals and plans to take part in initiatives to promote the company's advancement, there is no clear indication of their stance on following information security policies.

(option d) - It is impossible to tell",(option b) - William Carter,7499128018,171,"
Based on the given information, it appears that Emily Jones values compliance with her organization's security policies and views them as mandatory requirements. William Carter, on the other hand, believes that maintaining information security is solely the responsibility of the individual and is motivated by a desire to avoid damage to employee trust.

Therefore, it seems that William Carter may be less compliant with information security policies than Emily Jones. While both individuals value safeguarding sensitive data within their organization, William Carter's attitude toward enforcing security protocols appears more lax compared to Emily Jones's strict adherence to the company's rules.

Option (c) - Emily Jones is likely to be less compliant with information security policies than William Carter based on the given intelligence.",1,"Will information security non-compliance risk level increase if these employees work closely in the same team? Your answer must begin with (option

When these two employees work closely in the same team, their differing attitudes towards information security can potentially lead to a clash or conflicting perspectives. Emily may be more inclined to adhere to the organization's rules and policies, while William could take a more lenient approach. This difference in attitude could increase the risk of non-compliance with security protocols, potentially resulting in increased vulnerabilities for the company's technological assets and confidential data.",0,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?

While Benjamin Adams values the enforcement of the institution's Information Security Policies, Emma Williams obeys security protocols in order to receive incentives.

Working closely in the same team, it is possible that Emma Williams may influence Benjamin Adams to follow the organization's protocols to ensure security, as he has complete responsibility over following information security policies. However, there is a risk that Emma Williams' motivation for following the policies may be driven by the incentives she receives rather than a true understanding and valuing of the importance of information security.

However, if I had to choose one as the most important factor to focus on, I would say that option (b) - Subjective norms is likely the most relevant.

Subjective norms refer to an individual's perception of the expectations and norms of their social group or community, and how those norms influence their behavior. In the context of information security compliance, it seems that Liam Davis is particularly concerned with following rules for security measures in order to obtain benefits, and he also mentions the importance of complying with the organization's Information Security Policies. This suggests that Liam is strongly influenced by the subjective norms of his social group or community, and is motivated to follow information security guidelines in order to meet those expectations and avoid any negative consequences for not following them.

Therefore, targeting the strengthening of subjective norms could be a key strategy for increasing information security compliance among employees like Liam Davis who are highly influenced by social norms and expectations. This might involve measures such as promoting a culture of information security within the organization, highlighting the importance of compliance with security policies, and providing incentives or positive reinforcement for employees who follow best practices and adhere to security guidelines.

Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine who is less compliant with information security policies between Nicholas Anderson and Liam Brown.

Based on the information provided, it seems that both Nicholas Anderson and Liam Brown have different attitudes towards their organization's information security policies. While Nicholas Anderson plans to intentionally misuse information security resources within the company, Liam Brown is committed to safeguarding the data and technology assets of the company and knows specific policies in place for using technology.

Given these differences, it appears that the security non-compliance risk level may increase if these employees work closely in the same team. Nicholas Anderson's intention to misuse information security resources could potentially lead to a breach or compromise of the organization's data and systems, while Liam Brown's commitment to following security policies may not be enough to mitigate the risk posed by Anderson's actions.

Based on the given information, it seems that both Jacob Brown and Jacob Carter prioritize adhering to their organization's Information Security Policies.

On the other hand, Jacob Carter expresses strong commitment towards safeguarding the assets of his organization and most employees in his department already adhere to the information security policies.

Considering this information, it is possible that the security non-compliance risk level may increase if these employees work closely in the same team. This is because Jacob Brown's willingness to bypass security measures could potentially influence or encourage others in the team to do the same, increasing the overall risk of non-compliance with the organization's information security policies.

On the other hand, Jacob Carter has a strong sense of responsibility and moral code, is already aware of the organization's information security policies, and expresses commitment to safeguarding the assets of the organization. It appears that the majority of employees in Jacob Carter's department also adhere to the information security policies, suggesting that there may be a cultural norm of following these policies within the department. By targeting subjective norms and reinforcing the importance of following information security policies, it may be possible to increase compliance among all employees, including Jacob Brown.",0,2

While both William Rodriguez and Elijah Rivera express a strong desire to safeguard their organization's information and technological assets, and value compliance with the organization's security policies, their individual approaches to information security could potentially clash if they work closely in the same team.

William Rodriguez takes an active role in promoting the organization's progress and is from a department that has a strong emphasis on information security, but his recorded statement suggests that he may be willing to take risks or break rules if it benefits the organization. On the other hand, Elijah Rivera values strict compliance with the organization's security policies and is concerned about potential threats to their account if someone else knows their password.

However, it is also possible that their differing perspectives could complement each other and lead to a more comprehensive approach to information security.

This suggests that Olivia Williams may not fully comply with the organization's security policies.

On the other hand, Olivia Nguyen stated that their organization has specific rules outlining appropriate utilization of technological assets, and the person values strict compliance with the organization's security policies. Additionally, it is mentioned that the majority agrees on the need for safeguarding information and the individual is informed about the organization's protocol breaches and corresponding repercussions. This suggests that Olivia Nguyen is likely to comply with the organization's security policies.

Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine the impact of Olivia Williams and Olivia Nguyen working closely in the same team on the security non-compliance risk level.

However, it can be noted that both individuals value compliance with information security policies and have knowledge of the consequences of breaching these policies. Therefore, if they work together, it could potentially lead to a higher level of awareness and adherence to security policies, which may reduce the risk of non-compliance. On the other hand, working in close proximity could also create opportunities for unauthorized access or disclosure of sensitive information, potentially increasing the risk of non-compliance.

Therefore, option (d) - security non-compliance risk level may increase - would also be a reasonable answer, as the outcome depends on various factors such as the specific roles and responsibilities of the individuals, the security measures in place, and the organizational culture.",0,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?

(option a) - ['Self-efficacy', 'Commitment', 'Control', 'Attitude', 'Affect']

Explanation:

1. Self-efficacy: Both Jacob Martinez and Alex Patel demonstrate self-efficacy, which refers to an individual's belief in their ability to successfully perform a specific behavior or task. In this case, they show confidence in their abilities to contribute to the organization while adhering to its information security protocols (for Alex Patel) or intentionally misusing them (for Jacob Martinez).
2. Commitment: Both individuals exhibit commitment to their organization's standards for protecting information and upholding the institution's Information Security Policies, respectively.
3. Control: Jacob Martinez demonstrates control in following the company's information security protocols while expressing a desire to intentionally misuse them. Alex Patel does not explicitly show control but is motivated and dedicated to protecting information within the organization's standards.
4. Attitude: Both individuals have different attitudes towards the organization's information security protocols. Jacob Martinez sees rules as tools for testing limits, while Alex Patel views them as pointless. This difference in attitude affects their behavior and actions related to information security within the organization.
5. Affect: Although not explicitly mentioned in the given intelligence, it is possible that emotions such as frustration, motivation, or enthusiasm play a role in shaping Jacob Martinez's and Alex Patel's cognitive behavioral constructs. These emotions could influence their attitudes, commitment, and intentions to follow or violate the organization's information security protocols.",0,"Who is MORE compliant with information security policies?

Based on the information provided, it appears that Jacob Martinez is more compliant with information security policies than Alex Patel. According to the trusted experts and recorded statements, Jacob Martinez actively contributes to the advancement of the organization and values rebellion but sees rules as tools for testing limits. This suggests that he may be more likely to follow the company's information security protocols than someone who views these policies as pointless, like Alex Patel.

Additionally, while both individuals are skilled at their jobs, Jacob Martinez is described as being able to follow the company's information security protocols, which further supports the idea that he may be more compliant with these policies than Alex Patel.",1,"Will information security non-compliance risk level increase if these employees work closely in the same team?

The answer is (c) security non-compliance risk level may increase.

Even though both Jacob Martinez and Alex Patel have different attitudes towards following the organization's information security policies, their close working relationship could lead to increased risk of non-compliance. It is important to note that their individual motivations and skills are not directly related to each other. However, if they work closely together in a team where one member is dedicated to upholding information security standards while the other sees rules as tools for testing limits, it may lead to conflicting attitudes towards information security within the team. This could potentially increase the risk of non-compliance, depending on how their relationship affects their overall work performance and attitude towards following organization's security protocols.",0,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?

Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine with certainty whether the security non-compliance risk level will increase if these employees work closely in the same team. However, there are some factors that could suggest an increased risk.

Emily Garcia's statement indicates that she views following the institution's Information Security Policies as a necessary task but disregards them as insignificant. This could potentially lead to non-compliance with security policies if Emily works closely with Samantha Hughes, who has demonstrated a commitment to safeguarding valuable organizational assets and utilizes cybersecurity software for protection.

On the other hand, Samantha's dedication to protecting company resources could also serve as a positive influence on Emily, encouraging her to follow security protocols more diligently. Additionally, it is possible that their individual work habits and attitudes towards information security may not have a significant impact on each other in a professional setting.

Therefore, the answer to this question would be (option c) - security non-compliance risk level may increase. While there are potential indicators of increased risk, it is ultimately dependent on various factors such as their specific roles and responsibilities, the nature of their work environment, and how their individual attitudes towards information security evolve in a collaborative setting.",1,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?

(option d) - It is impossible to tell",(option a) - Rachel Thompson,6678320713,149,"
Based on the given intelligence, it seems that Rachel Thompson is more compliant with information security policies compared to Emily Johnson. This can be inferred from Rachel's statement ""Some believe it is necessary to safeguard sensitive data"" and her recognition of the potential consequences of breaking the organization's information security policy. In contrast, while Emily's colleagues believe in following the organization's security policy, she herself does not seem to have a strong personal conviction towards it, as she only declared equal opportunity in business relations and did not explicitly mention her commitment to safeguarding sensitive data.

Samantha Brown is described as being diligent about performing tasks and valuing following the organization's information security policies. However, it is also stated that they intentionally break these policies when it suits them, which suggests a lack of commitment to compliance. In contrast, Noah Martin admitted to gaining personal benefits by disregarding the information security policies but expressed a willingness to safeguard the assets of their institution, indicating a stronger commitment to adhering to the policies.

Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine the impact of these employees working closely in the same team on the security non-compliance risk level. However, we can make some assumptions based on the intelligence gathered.

Samantha Brown seems to be diligent in following the organization's protocol for securing information and values adherence to information security policies. On the other hand, Noah Martin has admitted to gaining personal benefits by disregarding information security policies but has also expressed a willingness to safeguard the assets of their institution.

If these employees work closely in the same team, it is possible that Samantha Brown's diligence and adherence to security policies could influence Noah Martin's behavior positively. However, it is also possible that Noah Martin's tendency to disregard security policies could negatively impact Samantha Brown's compliance with the policies.

Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot definitively say whether the security non-compliance risk level will increase or stay the same if these employees work closely in the same team.

For Alexa Brown:
Threat severity is high as they plan to intentionally abuse information security in their workplace. Intent is malicious. Costs could be significant, including financial losses and damage to the organization's reputation. Knowledge of security policies seems to be lacking, which makes them vulnerable. Motivation behind their actions appears to be unclear. Moral considerations are absent as they disregard the institution's Information Security Policies.

For Lucas Garcia:
Threat severity is moderate as proper use of computer resources can prevent data breaches, but following security protocols may not have direct consequences for their account safety. Intent is to follow rules and receive incentives. Costs of not following the rules may include losing incentives or facing disciplinary actions. Knowledge of the organization's rules seems adequate. Vulnerability depends on whether they can resist the temptation to share passwords with others. Motivation is driven by receiving incentives for compliance. Moral considerations appear absent as following rules may be seen as a necessity rather than an ethical choice.

For Marcus Diaz, his commitment to adhering to information security protocols and utilizing cybersecurity protection software indicates a strong belief in their importance. He also sees rules as necessary for society to function, suggesting a positive attitude towards following regulations. Additionally, he values the institution's Information Security Policies and strictly follows them, indicating a high level of self-efficacy and a desire to maintain social norms within his organization.

He also recognizes that being in compliance with these policies can lead to personal benefits, indicating a belief in their importance. Moreover, he perceives non-compliance as leaving his institution susceptible to cyber attacks, indicating a high level of threat severity and an awareness of the potential costs associated with security breaches.",0,"Who is MORE compliant with information security policies?

Based on the provided information, it appears that Ethan Williams is more compliant with information security policies than Marcus Diaz. Ethan Williams has made a commitment to enforcing the company's protocols for safeguarding data and takes an active role in promoting the growth of the organization by being in compliance with information security policies. On the other hand, while Marcus Diaz is dedicated to adhering to information security protocols and utilizes cybersecurity protection software, there is no mention of him actively promoting compliance within the organization or taking a leadership role in enforcing policies.

Therefore, the answer is (option d) Ethan Williams.",1,"Will information security non-compliance risk level increase if these employees work closely in the same team? Your answer must begin with (option

(option d) - It is impossible to tell",(option a) - security non-compliance risk level may increase,9269267579,264,"(option a) - security non-compliance risk level may increase.

The reasons for this are as follows:
Marcus Diaz is dedicated to adhering to information security protocols and has shown commitment in safeguarding the assets of his company. However, Ethan Williams values the institution's Information Security Policies and strictly follows them. Being in compliance with these policies could lead to benefits for him. This means that Ethan may be more likely to enforce the policies strictly, which could potentially clash with Marcus's approach of seeing rules as necessary but not necessarily following them to the letter.

Furthermore, if the two employees work closely in the same team, there is a higher chance of them coming across sensitive information that needs to be protected. If Ethan enforces the policies strictly and Marcus is more relaxed about following them, it could lead to a situation where important data is not adequately protected. This could increase the risk of a security breach, leading to serious consequences for the organization.

Overall, while both employees are committed to their respective approaches to information security, their differing views and work styles could potentially clash, leading to an increased risk of non-compliance with security protocols.",1,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?

Emily Anderson's statement expresses dedication to upholding their organization's policies for safeguarding information and prioritizing enforcement of these policies. However, the fact that their department struggles to enforce these policies suggests that there may be a lack of positive attitudes towards information security among some individuals in the workplace.

William Black's colleagues would disapprove of information security resource misuse, indicating that he values following organizational protocols for safeguarding information. He also expressed concern about sharing password information and emphasized the importance of security measures to protect sensitive data.

Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the security non-compliance risk level may increase if these employees work closely in the same team.",1,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?

Based on the information provided about Sarah Brown and Emily Hayes, here's an analysis of their cognitive behavioral constructs:

Sarah Brown:
(option a) - ['Costs', 'Attitude', 'Goal', 'Intent', 'Group norms']

Comments from experts indicate that Sarah Brown disregards the importance of following organizational Information Security Policies. However, she acknowledges the potential consequences of breaking these rules. The fact that Sarah willingly follows rules to gain benefits suggests that her goal is to benefit from the organization's data and technical assets while still adhering to its policies.

Emily Hayes:
(option a) - ['Costs', 'Attitude', 'Goal', 'Intent', 'Group norms']

Emily's organization has a history of unfair treatment towards its employees, and she values obedience, seeing rules as necessary for maintaining order. However, her department emphasizes the efficiency of implementing information security policy, and Emily feels pressure to comply with her company's security protocols. This suggests that her goal is to follow the organization's policies while recognizing the potential costs of non-compliance.",0,"Who is LESS compliant with information security policies?

Based on the information provided, it seems that the cognitive behavioral factor that should be targeted for strengthening to increase information security compliance is (option d) Belief.

In the case of Sarah Brown, the person's belief about the importance of following organizational Information Security Policies appears to be weak or lacking. The individual recognizes the importance of protecting vital organizational data and technical assets but still disregards information security rules when it best suits them. To increase compliance, it is essential to strengthen their belief in the significance of following these rules.

In the case of Emily Hayes, the person's department values information security and ensures compliance with policies, indicating that the Belief factor is already relatively strong within this group. However, for the broader organization, the history of unfair treatment towards employees suggests a potential lack of belief in the fairness of the company and its policies, which may negatively impact information security compliance. Therefore, targeting the Belief factor at the organizational level could be beneficial to improve overall compliance.",0,1

However, he also acknowledges that some individuals in the organization believe that computer security is not a crucial aspect.

Working together, Sophia and Stephen might be more likely to engage in non-compliant behavior if they perceive the company's policies as unfair or overly restrictive.

However, the statement ""Everyone is free to bend the rules to their own liking"" suggests that there may be some ambiguity or inconsistency in how these rules are enforced, which could lead to social challenges or issues around costs associated with non-compliance. Finally, the mention of having strict rules implies an intentional effort on Joseph Rodriguez's part to ensure compliance with security measures.",0,"Who is LESS compliant with information security policies?

It is difficult to say who is less compliant with information security policies based on the given intelligence. Both Sophia Nguyen and Emma Nguyen have demonstrated an understanding of the importance of following organizational information security policies, but they also both seem to be motivated by different factors.

Sophia Nguyen prioritizes integrity over personal gains, is dedicated to following organizational information security policy regardless of circumstances, and effortlessly implements cybersecurity protection measures. On the other hand, Emma Nguyen adheres to safety regulations for the sake of gaining bonuses, values the significance of following the organization's Information Security Policies, and expressed concern about potential consequences if their security was breached.

While both individuals seem compliant with information security policies, Sophia Nguyen may be more dedicated to upholding these policies out of a sense of integrity rather than motivated by external rewards such as bonuses. However, without further context or data, it is difficult to determine who is less compliant with information security policies.",1,"Will information security non-compliance risk level increase if these employees work closely in the same team?

However, based on the available intelligence, it seems that both individuals prioritize following organizational information security policies, albeit for different reasons.

Sophia Nguyen appears to have a strong commitment to implementing cybersecurity protection measures and prioritizes integrity over personal gains. On the other hand, Emma Nguyen's adherence to safety regulations is motivated by the desire to gain bonuses. While both individuals seem to value following organizational information security policies, their motives may differ.

If Sophia Nguyen and Emma Nguyen work closely in the same team, it is possible that they could influence each other's behavior. Sophia Nguyen's dedication to implementing cybersecurity protection measures and prioritizing integrity could potentially encourage Emma Nguyen to adhere more strictly to safety regulations out of a sense of responsibility rather than just seeking bonuses.

However, it is also possible that Emma Nguyen's motivation for following information security policies could be seen as less than genuine by Sophia Nguyen, which may lead to tension or disagreements within the team. This could potentially increase the non-compliance risk level if either individual is unwilling to compromise or follow through on their commitments.

In conclusion, it is difficult to predict with certainty whether the non-compliance risk level will increase if Sophia Nguyen and Emma Nguyen work closely in the same team. While both individuals prioritize following organizational information security policies, their motives may differ. The outcome will depend on how well they can collaborate and influence each other's behavior positively.",0,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?

Based on the information provided, it seems that both William Edwards and Benjamin Johnson have a strong commitment to following organizational information security policies. This suggests that their attitude towards information security compliance is already quite positive.

However, one cognitive behavioral factor that could be targeted for strengthening in order to increase information security compliance is subjective norms. Subjective norms refer to an individual's perception of the expectations and norms of their social group or community, including family members, peers, and leaders.

In the case of William Edwards, his dedication to ensuring his organization's information security is successful suggests that he already has a strong sense of subjective norms around following security protocols. However, in the case of Benjamin Johnson, it seems that his adherence to organizational security policies is influenced by the expectations and incentives set by the institution, rather than his own personal social group or community. Therefore, targeting the strengthening of subjective norms around information security compliance could be an effective way to increase adherence to organizational security policies for individuals like Benjamin Johnson.",1,2

Based on the given information, it seems that Olivia Rodriguez may be less compliant with information security policies as compared to Jessica Williams. Here's why:

Olivia Rodriguez finds operating cybersecurity protection software to be straightforward and uncomplicated, which suggests that they may not take information security seriously or prioritize it enough. Additionally, the individual expressed a willingness to safeguard the assets of their institution but may prioritize pleasing their boss over adhering to necessary security measures, indicating potential non-compliance with organization's policies.

On the other hand, Jessica Williams is committed to ensuring the success of information security within the organization and has a strong commitment to following their organization's information security policy. The individual considers complying with security procedures crucial and is committed to ensuring the organization's information security triumphs. Thus, it appears that Jessica Williams may be more compliant with information security policies than Olivia Rodriguez.

Therefore, option (a) - security non-compliance risk level may increase - is a reasonable answer.",1,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?

Ryan Davis perceives following institutional information security policies as mandatory and is dedicated to ensuring their organization's information security is successful. However, they are not actively engaged in promoting the organization's progress and development, indicating a lack of commitment. Ryan believes that preventive measures are futile in safeguarding personal information, which suggests a low perceived threat severity.

Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine whether the security non-compliance risk level will increase if these employees work closely in the same team. However, here are some possible scenarios:

(option d) - security non-compliance risk level may increase
If Olivia and Charlotte have different levels of knowledge and understanding of work-related compliance procedures, it is possible that one of them may unintentionally violate the organization's information security policy. This could potentially lead to an increased risk of a security breach or attack. Additionally, if Charlotte is dedicated to following the established information security policy but Olivia does not fully understand the consequences of violating these policies, this could also increase the risk of non-compliance.

(option b) - security non-compliance risk level will increase
If both Olivia and Charlotte lack comprehension of work-specific compliance protocols, it is possible that their lack of knowledge could lead to a higher risk of non-compliance. This is especially true if they are working closely together in the same team and have access to sensitive information or systems. Without proper training and education on compliance procedures, they may be more likely to make mistakes that could compromise the organization's security.

(option a) - security non-compliance risk level will stay the same
If both Olivia and Charlotte are committed to following the organization's information security policies, and their levels of knowledge and understanding are similar, it is possible that their combined efforts could actually decrease the risk of non-compliance. They may be able to monitor each other's actions and provide feedback or guidance on best practices for maintaining security. However, this assumption is based on limited information and may not necessarily hold true in all cases.

Overall, it is important to note that the impact of these employees working closely together on the organization's security non-compliance risk level will depend on various factors such as their specific roles, access levels, and willingness to learn and adhere to compliance procedures.",1,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?

Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine who is more compliant with information security policies between Alexander Diaz and Henry Brown. Both individuals have expressed a desire to safeguard their company's knowledge and technical assets, and both acknowledge the importance of following organizational rules and implementing security technologies. However, the information provided does not allow for a direct comparison of their compliance levels. Therefore, the answer is (c) It is impossible to tell.",1,"Will information security non-compliance risk level increase if these employees work closely in the same team?

Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine with certainty whether the security non-compliance risk level will increase if Alexander Diaz and Henry Brown work closely in the same team. However, here are some considerations:

* Alexander Diaz values personal relationships over organizational rules, which could potentially lead to conflicts with Henry Brown's adherence to information security policies. This could create a situation where one or both employees may be tempted to violate security policies in order to maintain their personal relationships, increasing the risk of non-compliance.
* On the other hand, Henry Brown acknowledges the importance of implementing information security policies and believes that most of his colleagues support it as well. This could suggest that he would work to ensure compliance in the team, which could mitigate the risk of non-compliance.

Overall, the risk level may increase due to Alexander Diaz's potential resistance to information security policies and the fact that Henry Brown acknowledges the low cost of implementing such policies, suggesting a willingness to follow them. However, it is also possible that both employees could work together to ensure compliance with security policies, in which case the risk level may not increase significantly. Therefore, the answer is (option c) - security non-compliance risk level may increase.",0,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?

Based on the provided information, it appears that subjective norms may be a key factor to target for strengthening in order to increase information security compliance. Subjective norms refer to an individual's perception of the expectations and social pressure from their peers or loved ones regarding a certain behavior or attitude. In this case, it seems that the individual's colleagues and loved ones strongly believe in following the organization's Information Security Policies, which can influence the individual's own attitudes and behaviors related to information security compliance. By focusing on strengthening subjective norms, the organization may be able to encourage greater adherence to the policies and improve overall compliance with information security practices.",0,1

(option d) - It is impossible to tell",(option a) - Jack Williams,11500297349,220,"
Based on the provided information, it seems that Logan Patel is more compliant with information security policies compared to Jack Williams. Here's why:

Logan Patel works in an organization that has a strong culture of information security compliance, and they personally believe in using security technologies to protect their assets. Additionally, they claim that any staff members who violate security protocols will face consequences, indicating that they take compliance seriously. While Logan Patel may lack knowledge about work-related compliance procedures, their overall attitude towards compliance seems positive.

On the other hand, Jack Williams struggles to operate cybersecurity programs and expressed concern about their safety if someone else discovers their password. Although they value strict compliance with the organization's security protocols, these statements suggest that Jack Williams may not be as diligent in following these protocols as Logan Patel.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it seems that Logan Patel is more compliant with information security policies than Jack Williams.",1,"Will information security non-compliance risk level increase if these employees work closely in the same team? Your answer must begin with (option

The information provided suggests that both Jack Williams and Logan Patel have different attitudes towards compliance with organization's security protocols. While Jack Williams values strict compliance, he struggles to operate cybersecurity programs, which could potentially lead to non-compliance. On the other hand, Logan Patel's department has a strong culture of information security compliance and believes in using security technologies to protect their assets, but Logan feels justified in bending the rules if there are no consequences.

Given these differences in attitudes towards compliance and the potential struggle of one employee to operate cybersecurity programs, it is likely that the non-compliance risk level will increase when these employees work closely in the same team. The combination of differing attitudes towards compliance and struggles with operating security technologies could lead to a higher likelihood of non-compliance, potentially increasing the overall risk level for the organization.",1,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?

Based on the provided intelligence, it seems that Logan Patel's department has a strong culture of information security compliance and staff members who violate security protocols will face consequences. Therefore, if we want to increase information security compliance, targeting Norms (option d) for strengthening would be appropriate. By emphasizing the importance of adhering to security protocols within the organization and promoting a culture that values and rewards compliant behavior, individuals like Logan Patel may feel more motivated to follow the rules and contribute to overall increased compliance.",0,3

However, it is important to note that having a strong understanding of workplace policies and following them is a positive factor in reducing the risk of non-compliance. Additionally, working collaboratively and respecting authority can also contribute to a more secure environment by promoting adherence to rules and regulations.

By reinforcing these social norms, you can help create a culture of security consciousness throughout the organization.

Explanation:
From the information provided, we can see that Emma Wilson values morality and honesty over personal gain and believes in strict actions for employees who violate data security guidelines. This suggests that she has a strong sense of adherence to group norms and societal regulations. She is also unfamiliar with the legal requirements for her job, which indicates a lack of knowledge about certain aspects of the company's operations.

Noah Cooper plans to intentionally misuse information security resources in their company, suggesting a belief that violating security measures can be successful. This behavior is likely motivated by costs associated with complying with information security policies. However, it is also noted that Noah participates in the organization's development efforts and strongly adheres to societal norms and regulations, indicating that he is influenced by group norms and moral values. Therefore, option (b) - ['Knowledge', 'Costs', 'Group norms', 'Moral', 'Norms'] best reflects Emma Wilson's cognitive behavioral constructs.",0,"Who is LESS compliant with information security policies?

Based on the given information, it is difficult to determine who is less compliant with information security policies between Emma Wilson and Noah Cooper. The information provided does not provide enough details about their specific actions or behaviors related to compliance with information security policies. Therefore, option (b) ""It is impossible to tell"" is the most appropriate answer.",0,"Will information security non-compliance risk level increase if these employees work closely in the same team? Your answer must begin with (option

Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine with certainty whether the security non-compliance risk level will increase if Emma Wilson and Noah Cooper work closely in the same team. However, option (b) - security non-compliance risk level may increase seems like a reasonable assumption given that Emma Wilson values morality and honesty over personal gain and is unfamiliar with the legal requirements for their job, while Noah Cooper plans to intentionally misuse information security resources in their company.

Working closely together could potentially create opportunities for Noah Cooper to influence Emma Wilson's actions or decisions related to information security, leading to an increased risk of non-compliance. However, it is important to note that this assumption is based on limited information and other factors such as the specific nature of their work, company policies and procedures, and individual behaviors could also impact the level of security non-compliance risk.",1,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?

Based on the provided information, it seems that the cognitive behavioral factor that should be targeted for strengthening in order to increase information security compliance is (option a) Belief. This is because beliefs play a crucial role in shaping an individual's attitudes and behaviors towards information security. In the case of Emma Wilson, their strict stance on data security guidelines and emphasis on morality and honesty suggest that they have strong beliefs about the importance of protecting sensitive information. Similarly, Noah Cooper's intention to misuse information security resources suggests that they may have weak or negative beliefs about the significance of complying with security policies. Therefore, targeting beliefs through education, training, and reinforcement of positive attitudes towards information security can help improve compliance in both cases.",1,2

* While Lucas Taylor expressed minimal need for additional resources in implementing information security policy, his intentions to intentionally violate protocols suggest that he may not be fully committed to following the organization's security procedures, which could increase the risk of non-compliance.

These statements indicate that he has a moral perspective on the use of technology in the workplace, and he believes that adhering to organizational policies can lead to positive outcomes.

Based on the given intelligence, we can infer the following about William Khan's and Jacob Patel's cognitive behavioral constructs:

* William Khan's cognitive behavioral constructs may include ""Response Efficacy"" (the belief in one's ability to perform a specific task or achieve a particular outcome) and ""Threat Severity"" (the perception of the severity of a potential threat). He seems to have a high level of self-efficacy and motivation to navigate through cybersecurity protection software, but he may not be fully aware of the potential consequences of data leaks.
* Jacob Patel's cognitive behavioral constructs may include ""Self-efficacy"" (the belief in one's ability to perform a specific task or achieve a particular outcome) and ""Motivation."" He seems to value the importance of following rules and policies related to cybersecurity and sees it as his duty. However, he also struggles with utilizing cybersecurity defense systems, which may indicate some vulnerability in this area.

Therefore, option (a) - [""Goal"", ""Social"", ""Response Efficacy"", ""Threat severity"", ""Self-efficacy""] and option (d) - [""Self-efficacy"", ""Motivation"", ""Self-efficacy"", ""Threat severity"", ""Response Efficacy""] seem to be the best options to reflect William Khan's and Jacob Patel's cognitive behavioral constructs, respectively.",0,"Who is MORE compliant with information security policies?

The answer depends on several factors such as the specific tasks and responsibilities of each employee, their level of expertise in cybersecurity, the security protocols and procedures in place at the company, and the overall culture of compliance within the organization.

If both William Khan and Jacob Patel are working together on a project that requires them to handle sensitive data or use cybersecurity technologies, then their different attitudes towards cybersecurity could create potential risks for the company. For example, if William Khan sees personal data leaks as having minimal consequences, he may be less motivated to follow security protocols, which could put the company's sensitive data at risk.

On the other hand, Jacob Patel recognizes the importance of following institutional information security policies and sees it as a mandatory duty. He also struggles with utilizing cybersecurity defense systems, which may indicate that he is not fully equipped to handle potential threats or breaches.

Therefore, if these employees work closely together in the same team, the security non-compliance risk level could potentially increase due to their different attitudes and skill levels in cybersecurity. However, it ultimately depends on various factors and cannot be determined with certainty without further information about the specific situation.",0,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?

These statements indicate that Alexander Baker takes information security seriously and is likely to comply with security policies and procedures.

By increasing an individual's sense of self-efficacy in this area, they are more likely to feel confident in their ability to follow established security protocols and take steps to protect the company's valuable assets.

(option d) - Lucy Wright is less compliant with information security policies. This can be inferred from the fact that Lucy sees following the institution's policies for information security as obligatory, but does not view the organization's issues as their own issues. In contrast, Abigail Kim expresses a desire to safeguard the company's data and technological assets, understands the repercussions of breaking the organization's information security policies, and acknowledges potential security risks if they don't follow Information Security Policies.",1,"Will information security non-compliance risk level increase if these employees work closely in the same team?

Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine with certainty whether the security non-compliance risk level will increase if these employees work closely in the same team. However, we can analyze the situation based on the given intelligence and provide an informed opinion.

For Lucy Wright:

* The individual lacks knowledge about adhering to work-related procedures, which could potentially lead to non-compliance with security policies.
* The person sees following the institution's policies for information security as obligatory but does not view the organization's issues as their own issues. This could mean that Lucy might not be as proactive in identifying and addressing potential security risks, which could contribute to an increase in non-compliance risk.

For Abigail Kim:

* The individual understands the repercussions of breaking the organization's information security policies and acknowledged potential security risks if they don't follow these policies. This suggests that Abigail is aware of the importance of information security and the consequences of non-compliance.
* However, the person believes their organization engages in fair competition with rivals. This could imply a willingness to take risks or adopt less secure practices in order to compete, which could potentially increase the security non-compliance risk level.

Considering both employees, their views seem to balance each other out. Lucy's lack of ownership over the organization's issues might be offset by Abigail's awareness of the risks and consequences of non-compliance. However, there are also potential factors that could increase the risk level, such as Abigail's competitive mindset and Lucy's lack of knowledge about adhering to work-related procedures.

In conclusion, it is difficult to definitively say whether the security non-compliance risk level will increase if these employees work closely in the same team. However, there are factors that suggest the risk may increase, as well as factors that could potentially mitigate this risk. Therefore, the answer is (option c) - security non-compliance risk level may increase.",0,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?

Therefore, focusing on increasing their intent to follow the organization's information security policies could be an effective way to increase compliance. This can be done through education and training on the importance of information security and how it benefits the individual and the organization.",1,2
