(option c) - Goal
(option d) - Costs",(option b) - Attitude,6051610593,309,"To increase information security compliance, the cognitive behavioral factor of threat severity should be targetted for strengthening. Threat severity refers to how high a person's level of concern is over a potential hazard or danger. For example, someone who is highly concerned about a potential hazard (e.g., a fire) may be more inclined to take proactive measures to prevent it from happening. On the other hand, someone who is not as concerned about a threat (e.g., a small problem that can be fixed in an afternoon) may not prioritize information security compliance efforts as much.

Furthermore, attitude plays a significant role in information security compliance. Individuals with positive attitudes towards their company's policies and procedures are more likely to follow them. Attitude is influenced by factors such as trust in leadership, respect for authority, and a sense of duty or obligation. By encouraging employees to prioritize information security compliance efforts, managers can create an environment where individuals feel supported and motivated to take proactive measures.

Finally, the cost of not following information security policies and procedures is high. The increased risk of data breaches, identity theft, and other forms of fraud requires that companies invest in robust information security programs and practices. By prioritizing information security compliance efforts, organizations can avoid financial losses and reputational damage associated with unresolved cybersecurity incidents.",0,0
