David Martinez demonstrates a strong commitment to safeguarding the company and adhering to established guidelines and safety protocols.

If these two individuals work closely in the same team, there is a possibility that Alexander Lee's approach to information security could negatively influence the team's overall compliance, especially if David's adherence is not sufficient to counterbalance Alexander's potential lapses.

Reason: Both Emma Mitchell and Benjamin Phillips have shown tendencies towards valuing personal relationships and general trust over strict adherence to security protocols, despite understanding the importance of the guidelines. Emma Mitchell values personal relationships, which might lead to leniency in enforcing strict policies. Benjamin Phillips, while committed to safeguarding assets, seems to rely on trust, which might lead to overlooking security protocol breaches.

Explanation:
For Emily Thompson, the provided information suggests strong adherence to security rules and protocols, a commitment to safeguarding assets, and the high value placed on following organizational guidelines. This fits well with the constructs of 'Response Efficacy' (confidence in the effectiveness of one's actions), 'Group norms' (accepted behavior in a group setting), 'Attitude' (personal stance towards following the rules), 'Goal' (the objective to protect data), and 'Subjective norms' (perceived social pressure to act in a particular way).
  
For Emily Smith, the information includes elements of expressing a willingness for security misconduct, valuing relationships over protocol, and recognizing the need for data security. However, these details align less consistently with the given options. Therefore, option c best encapsulates Emily Thompson's constructs.",0,"Who is LESS compliant with information security policies?

(option d) - It is impossible to tell",(option a) - security non-compliance risk level will increase,0,88,"(option a) - security non-compliance risk level will increase

Given Emily Smith's expressed desire to engage in information security misconduct and prioritization of relationships over protocols, if she works closely with Emily Thompson, who strictly follows information security protocols, there is a strong potential for conflict. This clash in principles and priorities could increase the risk of non-compliance, as Emily Smith's behavior might influence or undermine the strict adherence practices of Emily Thompson.",1,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?

Strengthening motivation is crucial in increasing information security compliance. While Emily Thompson already prioritizes and values adherence to information security protocols, enhancing motivation can further solidify her commitment.
