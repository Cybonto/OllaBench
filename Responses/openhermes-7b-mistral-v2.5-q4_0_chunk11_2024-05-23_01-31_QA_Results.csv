Increasing information security compliance can be achieved by targeting subjective norms. Subjective norms refer to the individual's perception of what others expect them to do and their belief in whether those individuals would approve or disapprove of their actions.

Olivia Davis prioritizes the adherence to the organization's security procedures, values information security policy, and disobeys company security rules only when it best suits her. This indicates a strong commitment to following established guidelines and maintaining a positive attitude towards information security. Her knowledge about the company's policies and their consequences demonstrates her understanding of the subject matter. The fact that she is part of a group that values security technologies also suggests a shared belief in the importance of these measures, which falls under 'group norms'.

Benjamin is willing to break information security policies for personal gain, views the institution's Information Security Policies as trivial, and has knowledge about the policy breaches and their consequences. This suggests that Benjamin may prioritize personal benefits over adherence to established norms ('Control') and has a negative attitude towards information security ('Attitude').

Emma Rodriguez seems to have a neutral attitude towards following organizational policies and regulations, as she lacks knowledge of adhering to them in relation to her job.

Emma's self-efficacy is high, as she adeptly employs cybersecurity protection software with minimal effort and is committed to following organizational policies even in challenging situations. Her affect is not mentioned in the information provided.

Working closely in the same team can potentially increase the security non-compliance risk level due to several factors. First, having two employees with different perspectives on information security can lead to conflicting ideas about best practices and policies. This can create confusion or lax enforcement of security measures. Second, when working together, there may be increased opportunities for unintentional sharing of sensitive information or exposure of vulnerabilities. While both individuals seem knowledgeable about information security, the potential for errors or oversights increases with close collaboration. Finally, a team with differing views on security compliance can create tension or resistance to adopting best practices, which could further exacerbate the risk level.

Ethan Jenkins seems to be more focused on the idea of challenging authority and misusing company resources, which indicates that their belief in rebellion plays a significant role in their behavior. They also believe in their organization's fair treatment of employees. This could lead them to have a positive attitude towards following rules when it aligns with their beliefs, but may be more likely to ignore or challenge rules they perceive as unfair or restrictive. Their knowledge about company information security resources and potential consequences of misuse is also important in this context.

James Harris seems more concerned with the potential dangers of password sharing and the organization's security protocols, indicating that they are aware of the threat severity. They feel uncomfortable and tense in their work environment due to these concerns. Their subjective norms might lead them to view the organization's Information Security Policies as insignificant if they perceive them as overly restrictive or not applicable in their situation. James Harris also has knowledge about policy breaches and their repercussions, which likely informs their attitudes towards information security.

Targeting subjective norms involves addressing the perceptions and attitudes of individuals towards adhering to information security protocols based on what their peers, supervisors, or organization as a whole value and expect from them. By aligning individual behaviors with the perceived expectations of others within their social environment, they are more likely to follow the established guidelines for information security. This approach is particularly effective when combined with clear communication from management about the importance of information security and the consequences of non-compliance.\n

Control, motivation, and goal setting can also be important factors in increasing information security compliance, but targeting subjective norms provides a broader and more holistic approach that takes into account social influences on individual behavior. This approach considers not only the individual's personal motivations and goals, but also their perceptions of what others expect from them in terms of adherence to information security protocols.\n

Encouraging a culture of compliance within an organization, where individuals understand that information security is crucial for the organization's success and well-being, can help strengthen subjective norms. By emphasizing the collective responsibility towards information security, organizations can foster a sense of unity and mutual accountability, leading to increased adherence to established protocols.\n

In summary, targeting subjective norms is an effective approach to increasing information security compliance, as it considers the influence of social context on individual behavior. By aligning personal beliefs and actions with what others within their social environment expect, individuals are more likely to follow information security guidelines.""",0,3
