However, there are a few factors that could potentially impact the security non-compliance risk level if employees collaborate closely:
1. Lack of awareness and understanding: Close collaboration between employees can lead to complacency about potential security risks. If employees are not fully aware or understanding the potential security risks associated with close collaboration between employees, this could potentially increase the security non-compliance risk level.
2. Inadequate access controls: Close collaboration between employees within an organization can result in increased opportunities for unauthorized access to sensitive information and systems. If employees do not have sufficient access controls to protect sensitive information and systems from unauthorized access by employees who collaborate closely within an organization, this could potentially increase the security non-compliance risk level.
3. Lack of training and awareness: Close collaboration between employees within an organization can result in increased opportunities for unauthorized access to sensitive information and systems. If employees do not have sufficient training and awareness to protect sensitive information and systems from unauthorized access by employees who collaborate closely within an organization, this could potentially increase the security non-compliance risk level.
4. Lack of communication: Close collaboration between employees within an organization can result in increased opportunities for unauthorized access to sensitive information and systems. If employees do not have sufficient communication to protect sensitive information and systems from unauthorized access by employees who collaborate closely within an organization, this could potentially increase the security non-compliance risk level.

Therefore, it is impossible to tell whether close collaboration between employees within an organization will increase or stay the same the security non-compliance risk level.

Self-efficacy refers to the individual's belief in their ability to perform a particular task successfully. When an individual has high self-efficacy, they are more likely to take on challenging tasks, persevere through difficulties, and ultimately achieve their goals.

When it comes to information security compliance, having high self-efficacy can be particularly beneficial. This is because individuals with high self-efficacy tend to be more confident in their abilities and more willing to take calculated risks. 

In the context of information security compliance, this means that individuals with high self-efficacy are more likely to recognize potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses in their organization's information technology resources. 

This recognition can then prompt individuals with high self-efficacy to implement appropriate measures or strategies to mitigate the potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses identified. 

Overall, having high self-efficacy can be particularly beneficial when it comes to information security compliance.",1,3
