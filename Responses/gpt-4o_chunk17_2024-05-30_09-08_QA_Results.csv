This option reflects the cognitive behavioral constructs present in the descriptions of Olivia Wilson and William Anderson. Here’s how each construct applies:

- **Affect**: William Anderson is experiencing anxiety or tension from their work environment.
- **Attitude**: Both individuals’ attitudes towards following the institution's Information Security Policies are highlighted. Olivia Wilson disregards these policies, while William Anderson values them highly.
- **Threat severity**: William Anderson acknowledges the severity of the threat by stating that a potential hacker could easily gain access to his account.
- **Knowledge**: Olivia Wilson effortlessly utilizes cybersecurity protection technology, indicating a high level of knowledge in this area.

Explanation: Olivia Wilson demonstrates a disregard for following the institution's Information Security Policies, which could lead to non-compliance issues. On the other hand, William Anderson values these policies but acknowledges that security measures can be time-consuming and labor-intensive, which could contribute to his anxiety. If Olivia's behavior influences William or if William's stress exacerbates due to Olivia’s non-compliance, it could lead to an overall increased risk of security non-compliance within the team. However, since it is not certain how they will affect each other's behavior, the risk ""may increase"" rather than ""will increase.""",0,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?

Given Nathan Garcia's pride in detailed guidelines for computer resource usage and the strict organizational consequences for violating information security protocols, it suggests a strong emphasis on compliance. However, the mention of a potential dread of facing consequences indicates some vulnerability to mistakes or pressures.

On the other hand, Jason Kim is involved in ensuring data and technology safety but seems concerned about the alienation that enforcing security policies might cause. This duality suggests that while both individuals have a vested interest in maintaining security, there may be underlying tensions or differing approaches to compliance.

When these two employees work closely together, the interaction of their differing attitudes and pressures could potentially lead to lapses or increased risks in information security compliance. Therefore, while it is not a certainty, the risk level may increase.",0,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?

**Reasoning:**
Based on the provided information, Olivia Campbell emphasizes the importance of implementing security measures, compliance with information security policies, and safeguarding information and technology resources. She is also committed to improving and contributing to the organization's success, suggesting a strong adherence to information security practices.

In contrast, there is no specific mention of Samantha Brown's commitment to information security policies. Moreover, she feels anxious and uneasy due to work and perceives unfair tactics in her organization, which may indicate potential vulnerabilities in her compliance behavior under stress.

Hence, Samantha Brown appears less compliant with information security policies compared to Olivia Campbell.",1,"Will information security non-compliance risk level increase if these employees work closely in the same team? Your answer must begin with (option

However, Olivia Campbell is highly dedicated to safeguarding the organization's information and technology resources and is committed to compliance with the institution's information security policies.

Thus, while Olivia's commitment to information security is clear, Samantha's anxiety and perceived unfairness may affect her compliance, creating a risk that could potentially increase if they work closely together.
