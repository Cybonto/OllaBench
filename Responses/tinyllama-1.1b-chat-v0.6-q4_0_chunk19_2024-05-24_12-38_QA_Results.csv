Moreover, knowledge plays a crucial role in increasing information security compliance. Employees who have the necessary knowledge to understand and apply information security policies are better equipped to identify potential risks and implement appropriate controls and measures.

By training employees in relevant information security topics, companies can ensure that they have adequate knowledge of best practices and procedures for protecting sensitive information.

Benefits are also important factors to consider when strengthening information security compliance. Companies should aim to maximize the benefits of their information security policies by providing training and education opportunities to employees, as well as conducting regular assessments to ensure that they remain effective in addressing potential threats. Additionally, companies can encourage employee engagement through rewards and recognition programs to recognize their efforts in adhering to information security protocols.

Cognitive behavioral factor (c) refers to the person's tendency to take shortcuts and adopt ineffective techniques that do not necessarily lead to success. By strengthening the c factor, it is possible to encourage individuals to adopt more effective strategies for information security compliance. For example, by encouraging employees to develop a proactive attitude towards securing company assets, they can increase their motivation and sense of ownership in protecting sensitive information. The following tips may also be helpful in achieving this goal:

1. Provide training on information security protocols: Employees should be educated about the importance of following established procedures and protocols for securing company assets, such as password practices, access controls, data encryption, and access logging.
2. Encourage employees to report vulnerabilities and security breaches: Encouraging employees to notify management if they come across a potential security breach is a good way to increase the organization's awareness of information security risks.
3. Monitor employee behavior: Employees should be encouraged to monitor their own behavior, such as avoiding unauthorized access or using weak passwords, as a way of identifying any potential security threats in real-time.
4. Regularly review and update security policies: Periodically reviewing and updating information security protocols can help ensure that they remain relevant and effective. This will also help to reinforce the importance of following established guidelines for securing company assets.
5. Conduct regular risk assessments: Encouraging employees to conduct regular risk assessments of their own organizations' security measures can help them identify areas where their policies may need improvement or where specific vulnerabilities may exist.",0,1

Attitude is a complex concept that can influence an individual's perception of their own or others' risk, and therefore, how they behave with respect to their IT systems.

A strong attitude towards information security can lead to higher compliance rates, reducing the likelihood of data breaches, system failures, and other cyber incidents. A positive attitude towards protecting information leads individuals to be more proactive in securing their systems, which can be achieved by implementing strong policies, regular audits, and educating employees about the importance of data security.

Furthermore, a threat severity factor would also help in improving information security compliance. This factor is based on the level of risk to an individual's organization's data and systems. A high threat severity factor indicates that an organization's IT systems are at high risk of attack and should be more vigilant about securing them.

Lastly, a cost-effectiveness factor would help in improving information security compliance by considering the costs associated with cyber incidents such as data breaches, system failures, and other related events. This factor could lead to an organization taking preventative measures against cyber threats, instead of simply reacting after they have occurred.",0,2
