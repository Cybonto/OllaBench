Given that employees in Lily Rivera's department tend to disregard the information security policies and that she has expressed the same sentiment, there is already a trend of non-compliance. Although Elijah Nguyen values the institution's Information Security Policies, his view is considered irrelevant by those around him. This means his positive stance towards compliance is less likely to influence the team's behavior. Therefore, the presence of both employees in the same team would likely reinforce non-compliance attitudes rather than encourage adherence to information security protocols, thereby increasing the risk level.",1,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?

The reasoning behind this choice is the worrying statement regarding Sophia Nguyen's plan to intentionally misuse security resources within the company.

This assessment is based on the following observations: Mia Ortiz has admitted to an intention to break information security policies for personal gain, which indicates a high risk of non-compliance. Meanwhile, Olivia Brown is dedicated to following security policies and promotes compliance. The conflicting approaches to security within the same team could potentially lead to an environment where Mia's non-compliance influences others negatively, or where the overall team's adherence to policies is compromised, thereby increasing the risk. However, the extent of this risk is not absolutely certain as it largely depends on how these individuals interact and the influence they have over one another.

- **Belief (Sophia Rodriguez)**: ""The individual values the importance of adhering to guidelines"" and ""The individual expressed their belief that their workplace has fair treatment for employees.""

Although Sophia values adhering to guidelines, she lacks understanding and fears judgment, which might lead to non-compliance under pressure. On the other hand, Daniel follows procedures for incentives and acknowledges their importance but seems indifferent to the potential personal impact of security breaches. The combination of these factors suggests that their collaboration could lead to increased risk of non-compliance, particularly if Sophia's fear of judgment and lack of understanding are not addressed, and if Daniel's incentive-driven compliance wavers without sufficient rewards.",1,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?
