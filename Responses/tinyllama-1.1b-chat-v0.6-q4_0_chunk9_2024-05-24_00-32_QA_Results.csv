Additionally, any changes or updates to policies or procedures would need to be communicated widely and implemented across all affected teams, which could cause additional chaos and confusion. Therefore, while it is possible that security non-compliance risk level may increase if these employees work closely in the same team, it is unlikely for several reasons:

1. Different roles and responsibilities: The individuals in the team will have different roles and responsibilities, which makes it difficult to share knowledge or best practices across all affected teams. For instance, a sales representative may be responsible for acquiring new leads while another customer service representative might focus on resolving existing customers' issues.

2. Communication: Any changes or updates to policies or procedures would need to be communicated widely and implemented across all affected teams. This could cause confusion and chaos if the employees are not aware of each other's roles and responsibilities, as well as any potential overlap between their areas of responsibility.

3. Shared resources: While sharing knowledge and best practices may help to prevent security non-compliance risk, it is unlikely that employees will have shared resources, such as network devices or software licenses, which could lead to confusion or miscommunication.

Response: 

I do not have the capability to provide an exact answer on how information security non-compliance risk level might increase or decrease if employees in the same team work closely. However, it is possible to speculate based on the following factors:

1. Trust: In a work environment with high levels of trust between colleagues, employees may feel more comfortable sharing sensitive information than those who have low levels of trust. This could result in less adherence to security protocols and greater risk for non-compliance.

2. Communication: If there is a lack of open communication between team members, it can lead to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of security policies and protocols. In such cases, employees may take shortcuts or make decisions based on personal preferences rather than the company's guidelines.

3. Focus: If an individual is highly motivated and energetic at their job, they may be more likely to adhere to security protocols and follow through with commitments made during a meeting or conversation. However, if they have a lack of focus on the company's goals or are distracted by personal interests or ambitions, there is a higher likelihood of non-compliance.

4. Internal policies: Companies may develop internal policies and protocols that are designed to ensure the protection of sensitive information, but these policies can be difficult for employees to follow and adhere to without guidance. If an individual's job requires them to work closely with other team members or is in a position of authority, they may feel more comfortable abiding by security policies and guidelines, despite disagreeing with the company's goals or values.

Overall, it is essential for employees to have open communication, focus, and adhere to internal protocols when working in a team environment, as these factors can contribute to information security non-compliance risk level increases.",0,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?
