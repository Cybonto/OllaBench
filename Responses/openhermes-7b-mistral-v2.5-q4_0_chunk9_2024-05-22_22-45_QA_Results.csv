Since Dylan Martin is committed to following the organization's security policies and Olivia Rodriguez plans to attempt a violation of data protection protocols, their contrasting attitudes towards information security could potentially create conflicts or vulnerabilities within the team. The increased interaction between these two employees may lead to an environment where security non-compliance risk is higher than if they were working separately or with other colleagues who share similar attitudes towards compliance.

Alexander Evans's and Olivia Cruz's cognitive behavioral constructs can best be described by group norms, moral, knowledge, intent, and knowledge. 

Both individuals seem to have a strong sense of group norms - Alexander Evans believes his company practices fair competition and Olivia Cruz affirms her organization's commitment to equitable treatment of staff. They also both show knowledge about their respective organizations' policies - Alexander Evans knows about policy breaches, while Olivia Cruz is aware of information security protocols. 

Their moral beliefs are evident in their actions: Alexander Evans intends to misuse information security resources and disregards following policies, whereas Olivia Cruz values integrity over personal gain and takes responsibility for safeguarding her organization's data and technology.

Intent plays a significant role as well. Alexander Evans has an intent to misuse information security resources within his company while Olivia Cruz aims to follow the organization's policies. 

Knowledge about their job responsibilities is also crucial: Alexander Evans lacks knowledge of protocols necessary for his job, whereas Olivia Cruz states her computing resources are safe and not susceptible to security risks at work. This shows a contrast in their understanding and handling of their respective roles within the organization.

Explanation: Combining the information about Emma Davis and Mary Johnson, it is clear that both employees have different views on information security protocols. While Emma sees following policies as pointless and may be willing to compromise them, Mary is dedicated to enforcing those same policies. By working closely together in the same team, their contrasting perspectives on information security can potentially lead to disagreements or conflicts that might result in non-compliance with organizational protocols. This increases the risk of security breaches and other issues related to information security.",1,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?

Ryan Kim demonstrates commitment to enforcing the organization's protocols and establishing effective information security within the organization. This indicates a strong sense of personal dedication to the task at hand. The individual also acknowledges the potential threats (severity) that can occur if security protocols are not followed. By recognizing these risks, Ryan Kim is more likely to prioritize adherence to security policies and create goals around maintaining strong information security.

By acknowledging this issue, Samuel Gomez demonstrates an understanding of threat severity and its potential impact on the organization. The individual's willingness to follow policies with integrity further indicates their dedication to maintaining a secure environment.

Working closely in the same team can potentially increase the security non-compliance risk level due to a number of factors. First, both Alexa Miller and Max Thompson have different attitudes towards information security policies and compliance. While Alexa may be more lenient on using unauthorized tools, Max prioritizes following organizational guidelines strictly. When working together closely, these conflicting approaches can lead to misunderstandings or even circumvention of established security procedures.

Secondly, both individuals could potentially introduce new vulnerabilities to the organization's information security infrastructure. Alexa may use unsecured tools, while Max might implement stricter measures that others find inconvenient or unnecessary, creating friction and possible non-compliance within the team. This can lead to a weakening of the overall security posture if not managed properly.

Lastly, the collective responsibility to safeguard sensitive data mentioned for people in the organization may be challenged in a situation where different individuals hold contrasting views on information security policies. This could result in complacency or even deliberate disregard for the established protocols when working together closely.
