Explanation: Combining the information provided about Olivia Miller and Olivia Davis, it appears that both individuals have different approaches to information security. Olivia Miller is willing to compromise information security for their boss's approval and may be more inclined to break rules if it benefits them. On the other hand, Olivia Davis views following Information Security Policies as mandatory and would likely disregard those policies if working with someone who does not adhere to them.

When these two individuals work closely in the same team, their contrasting attitudes towards information security could lead to a higher risk of non-compliance. This is because Olivia Miller's approach may influence Olivia Davis to compromise on following the institution's policies, while Olivia Davis's adherence to rules might cause Olivia Miller to push boundaries and ignore security measures more frequently. This potential conflict in attitudes could create a riskier environment for information security non-compliance.",1,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?

Explanation: 
Olivia Wilson seems to prioritize morality, honesty, and the organization's development. This indicates that her cognitive behavioral construct focuses on an ""Attitude"" of following security policies for the good of the organization. Her goal is likely aligned with these values, making it a strong aspect of her thinking. She recognizes the benefits of information security but prioritizes convenience over it, indicating some intent to follow or break the rules depending on the situation. This suggests that 'Intent' and 'Benefits' are part of her cognitive construct as well.

Liam Rodriguez appears to be considering intentionally misusing information security resources in their workplace. His thinking revolves around the potential benefits of such action, which is why 'Benefits' is a significant aspect of his cognitive behavioral construct. However, his thoughts also involve recognizing the potential costs and vulnerabilities associated with such actions ('Costs' and 'Vulnerability'). While he hasn't explicitly mentioned norms or threat severity in the provided information, these could be part of his cognitive construct as well.

Option (a), (b), and (d) do not fully capture the cognitive behavioral constructs of both individuals.

(option d) - security non-compliance risk level will stay the same",(option a) - security non-compliance risk level will increase,10966139343,355,"Option a - security non-compliance risk level will increase

When employees with different attitudes towards information security work closely together in the same team, it is likely that the security non-compliance risk level will increase. Olivia Wilson's focus on convenience over security and valuing morality and honesty may clash with Liam Rodriguez's intention to abuse information security resources. This can lead to potential security breaches or violations of company policies. Moreover, if Olivia Wilson becomes pressured by Liam Rodriguez to compromise the organization's development in favor of his own intentions, this could also increase the risk of non-compliance with information security policies.\n

To minimize this increased risk, it is essential for both employees to be aware of their respective attitudes towards information security and how they can impact the team's overall compliance. The team should receive training on the importance of following information security policies and procedures, and there should be open communication about expectations and potential consequences of non-compliance.\n

Additionally, the management should closely monitor the team's adherence to information security policies and take corrective actions if necessary, such as reassigning employees or implementing additional controls to mitigate risks. By addressing these challenges proactively, the organization can maintain a healthy balance between convenience and strict adherence to security protocols while fostering a secure and productive working environment for all employees involved.\n

In conclusion, it is crucial to recognize that the increased risk level may not be an immediate outcome, but rather a potential one. The team's dynamic and individual growth in their understanding of information security could also lead to a decrease in this risk over time.",1,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?

Working closely in the same team can have varying effects on information security non-compliance risk levels. If both employees are highly dedicated to following the established Information Security Policies and have a strong understanding of the importance of compliance, they may be able to support and reinforce each other's commitment to maintaining security. Alternatively, if one or both individuals have a tendency to cut corners or disregard policies in the interest of productivity, this could potentially increase the risk of non-compliance.

This is because an individual's attitude towards information security policies and practices can greatly influence their adherence to those guidelines. By fostering a positive attitude towards information security, individuals are more likely to prioritize the protection of sensitive data and follow established protocols, ultimately leading to improved compliance within the organization.\n

Experts often emphasize the importance of addressing attitude when promoting information security compliance, as it can serve as a foundational element for other cognitive behavioral factors such as belief, affect, and response efficacy. By focusing on attitude first, organizations can create a strong foundation for an overall culture of security, making it easier to address other areas of concern as they arise.\n

In the case of Matthew Chen and Sarah Rodriguez, their positive attitudes towards information security are evident in their statements and actions. By reinforcing this mindset within the organization, companies can promote a stronger sense of responsibility and dedication towards safeguarding digital assets.\n\n

Additionally, addressing attitude can also help overcome potential resistance or apathy towards information security measures. By emphasizing the importance of information security and its benefits to the individual and the organization as a whole, employees may be more inclined to adopt secure practices and follow established guidelines. This, in turn, can lead to increased compliance with information security policies and procedures.\n

Emily Davis's statement reflects the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), consisting of attitude, subjective norms, social influence, and behavioral intention. In this case, the relevant factors are subjective norms, benefits, and norms. 

For Ethan Garcia, the presence of vulnerability implies he may not be adhering to the information security policies. The threat severity might not be high enough for him to prioritize information security. His statement also emphasizes the importance of following organizational norms, suggesting that he values following the rules but does not necessarily understand the consequences of a potential breach.

For Emily Davis, her commitment to following organizational information security policies aligns with the Theory of Planned Behavior's focus on attitude and subjective norms.

Response Efficacy refers to an individual's belief in the effectiveness of a particular response or action to address a problem. In this case, it could refer to their confidence in following the security measures set by the company or implementing information security policies.

Attitude reflects the overall evaluation or feeling about something, in this case, computer security or adherence to data protection policies.

Threat Severity is the perception of how serious a potential threat is, such as being concerned about account security or not seeing computer security as a priority.

Norms refer to social expectations and pressures from others, like overseeing a team that strictly follows information security policies or disregarding institution's Information Security Policies as insignificant.

Attitude is repeated because it is an essential element in most cognitive behavioral constructs. It reflects the overall evaluation or feeling about something, and in this case, it includes computer security and adherence to data protection policies.

Explanation: Liam Black and Chloe Thompson's cognitive behavioral constructs align with the Theory of Planned Behavior. In this theory, attitude, subjective norms (replaced by self-efficacy in the revised version), and perceived behavioral control (response efficacy) are the key factors that determine one's intention to perform a specific behavior. Intentions then lead to behaviors. 

In this case, Liam Black and Chloe Thompson's intent is related to their adherence to information security policies and commitment to safeguarding their company's assets. Their attitudes are positive towards the institution's policies, they feel fulfilled by protecting the company, and take these policies seriously. Self-efficacy is demonstrated through their commitment to ensuring the effectiveness of the organization's information security. Response efficacy refers to their belief in the effectiveness of the safety protocols. Lastly, benefits are the perceived positive outcomes of adhering to these policies (e.g., safeguarding assets).
