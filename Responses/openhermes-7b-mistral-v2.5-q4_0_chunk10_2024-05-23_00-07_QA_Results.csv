In this case, the cognitive behavioral constructs related to information security can be best understood through the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), which is a widely used model in the field of psychology. According to TPB, an individual's intention to perform a particular behavior (in this case, following information security protocols) is determined by their attitudes towards the behavior, subjective norms (social influences), perceived control over performing the behavior, and motivation.

1. Subjective Norms: In the cases of both Adam Jones and Benjamin Cruz, their loved ones prioritize information security, indicating that there is a social influence to follow the institution's information security protocols. This falls under the subjective norms construct in TPB.
2. Attitude: Both individuals value following information security policies and safeguarding confidential data. This shows their positive attitude towards information security practices.
3. Control: Adam Jones may violate safety protocols for personal benefit, which suggests a lack of perceived control over their actions. On the other hand, Benjamin Cruz is committed to following their organization's information security policy, indicating that they perceive they have control over their actions.

On the other hand, Olivia Brown values the institution's Information Security Policies as a priority and expects following company's security policies, which reflects her adherence to norms and having a sense of control.

This option includes the key components of the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), which is a widely used framework in understanding how individuals respond to health risks and security threats. In this case, the threats are related to information security and data protection.

The Protection Motivation Theory suggests that an individual's motivation to protect themselves depends on their perception of response efficacy (how effective the recommended actions are), threat severity (how severe they believe the risk to be), attitude (their overall beliefs and opinions about the risk), benefits (perceived advantages of following security guidelines), and social influences (what others do or say about the issue). 

In Alexa Williams's case, her concern over account security, valuing institutional information security policies, and expressing a desire to follow these policies indicate that she perceives response efficacy as high, threat severity as significant, has a positive attitude towards information security, sees benefits in following the guidelines, and is influenced by social factors.

In Olivia Garcia's case, her disregard for information security policies and her concern over someone else knowing her password suggest that she may not perceive response efficacy to be as high, may have a lower threat perception, has a more neutral or negative attitude towards information security, sees fewer benefits in following the guidelines, and is less influenced by social factors.",1,"Who is LESS compliant with information security policies?

To increase information security compliance, the attitude of both Mason Rodriguez and Isabella Brooks should be targetted for strengthening. The statements provided indicate that their attitudes towards security protocols differ significantly.

For Mason Rodriguez, it appears that they have a positive attitude towards following security procedures and taking information security seriously. This indicates that their adherence to security policies is already strong, but reinforcing this positive attitude could help maintain and even improve compliance over time. This could be achieved through continued education on the importance of security protocols, as well as recognizing and rewarding employees who demonstrate a strong commitment to information security.

For Isabella Brooks, their lack of comprehension of procedures required for adherence to job responsibilities and valuing obedience and adherence to societal norms and regulations could indicate that they have a negative attitude towards information security or find it challenging to understand its importance. To address this issue, it would be beneficial to focus on improving their understanding of the reasons behind security protocols and why they are essential for protecting both the organization and themselves. This could involve more detailed training sessions, providing real-life examples of security breaches and their consequences, and addressing any potential misunderstandings or misconceptions about the role of information security in the organization.

Explanation: The information provided in the intelligence about Joseph Williams and Olivia can be mapped to the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), which is a cognitive-based model that explains how people respond to threats.

Option (a) does not address all the necessary factors as it mentions 'Attitude' and 'Norms' twice but misses other key factors like 'Benefits', 'Costs', and 'Control'.

Option (b) is incorrect because it includes 'Response Efficacy' instead of 'Subjective norms'.

Option (c) does not include all necessary factors as it skips 'Threat severity' and 'Moral' is not mentioned in the intelligence.

- 'Benefits': Joseph Williams values following the institution's Information Security Policies, while Olivia believes that implementing security measures is necessary.
