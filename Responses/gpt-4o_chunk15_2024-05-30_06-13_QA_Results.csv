Jacob Campbell, on the other hand, disregards security policies for personal benefit and believes his coworkers are unsupportive in learning about these policies, which indicates a potential for higher risk behavior.

Given the contrasting attitudes towards information security, placing these two individuals in the same team could create a dynamic where Jacob’s non-compliance behaviors might influence the team environment, potentially increasing the risk level if David is unable to mitigate this influence. However, it might also provide an opportunity for Jacob to be positively influenced by David's adherence to policies.

Given that Olivia Stevens is proactive in taking preventative measures against breaches and is engaged in advancing the organization's progress, while Mira Patel views Information Security Policies as insignificant and disregards their importance, there is a clear misalignment in their approach towards information security.

In the case of both Olivia Stevens and Mira Patel, focusing on group norms can be particularly effective. For Olivia, even though she is already taking preventative measures, reinforcing group norms around information security can sustain and improve overall compliance.

2. **Olivia Cook**: While she values the significance of Information Security Policies and follows them for incentives, she believes it is not her job to protect the organization's information. This mindset can lead to gaps in the security framework, as there is a fundamental lack of ownership and proactive responsibility towards information security.

- Intent: She has a promise to safeguard the company's valuable assets.
- Attitude: She values and respects the institution's policies regarding Information Security.
- Affect: No clear emotional response indicated.
- Self-efficacy: Implicit in her adherence to security policies with an understanding that it leads to benefits.

For Daniel Rodriguez:
- Response Efficacy: Emphasized low costs of implementing security measures, indicating a belief in the effectiveness.
- Benefits: Values strict compliance with security policies.
- Intent: Could misuse security resources, suggesting a negative intent.
- Attitude: Sees following security protocols as unproductive.
- Motivation: Mix of compliance and possible misuse suggests conflicting motivations.

Given that Samantha Jones prioritizes following the rules mainly for personal benefit and may not have a deep intrinsic motivation for security, combined with Daniel Rodriguez's view that security protocols are unproductive and his potential intention to misuse security resources, the dynamic between the two could lead to increased vulnerabilities. Samantha may be swayed by Daniel's negative views on security protocols, potentially leading her to lax compliance, and Daniel's potential misuse of resources could further exploit these weaknesses.",0,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?

To increase information security compliance, targeting the cognitive behavioral factor of benefits could be effective. For Samantha Jones, the motivation to comply is tied to the benefits she perceives from following the rules. Emphasizing the advantages and positive outcomes of adhering to information security policies will likely reinforce her compliance. Meanwhile, for Daniel Rodriguez, aligning compliance with personal or professional rewards might shift his view of the task from being unproductive to being beneficial. Therefore, focusing on the benefits of compliance could help in strengthening their commitment to information security practices.",0,1

Emma Williams demonstrates a strong loyalty to the company's information security policy despite any circumstances. However, she lacks knowledge of workplace laws and expresses dissatisfaction with the organization's treatment of employees, which may indirectly affect her adherence to policies.

- Emily Brown values the institution's security policies but may disregard regulations for personal benefit.
- Emma Davis has conflicting reports: some statements suggest she disrespects the Information Security Policies and will sacrifice integrity, while others reflect a commitment to ethical practices and safeguarding company assets.

Matching these insights to the constructs provided in the options:

### For Emily Brown:
- Values institution's security policies -> [`Attitude`]
- May disregard regulations for personal benefit -> [could imply `Costs` or `Motivation`]

### For Emma Davis:
- Willing to sacrifice integrity -> [`Costs`]
- Disrespects Information Security Policies but also expressed commitment to safeguarding assets -> [`Attitude`, contradictory though could focus more on `Motivation`]

### Matching to Options:

  - Fits: Emily's disregard for regulations for personal benefit aligns with `Costs`, her valuing of security policies aligns with `Attitude`.
  - Fits: Emma's willingness to sacrifice integrity aligns with `Costs`, commitment and ethical practices might hint towards `Motivation`.

#### Option (b)
