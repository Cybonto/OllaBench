For Alexander Myers:
- The statement suggests dissatisfaction with the company's policies.

For Ethan Carter:
- Emphasis on using security technologies to safeguard sensitive data.
- Takes information security policies seriously.
- Colleagues would disapprove of information security breaches.
- Commitment to following organizational safety protocols.
- Ability to safeguard against breaches.

These points indicate that for both individuals, particularly Alexander Myers and Ethan Carter, cognitive behavioral constructs such as Subjective norms and Attitude (influenced by the organization's expectations), and Control (particularly in Ethan Carter's case) are crucial. 

Therefore, the best choice reflecting the cognitive behavioral constructs relevant for both is:

On the other hand, Ethan Carter is portrayed as someone who takes information security very seriously and is committed to following safety protocols.

If these two employees work closely in the same team, there could be a risk of friction or lack of cooperation concerning information security practices. While Ethan Carter's strong adherence to security protocols could help mitigate risks, Alexander Myers's potential dissatisfaction and possibly lax attitude towards security could undermine these efforts.

Given the information provided, Lauren Campbell has conflicting indicators about her approach toward information security protocols. While she is committed to safeguarding the company's assets and recognizes the importance of information security policies, she rationalizes breaking rules if she can avoid consequences. On the other hand, Ethan Rodriguez has a rebellious or nonconformist mindset but is stated to follow organizational policies and is committed to safeguarding organizational assets.

When these types of conflicting attitudes towards information security coexist within the same team, there is a potential risk for increased non-compliance. The influence of Lauren's rationalization for breaking rules could be compounded by Ethan's rebellious mindset, leading to a scenario where security protocols might be more frequently challenged or violated. This combination suggests that the security non-compliance risk level may increase if these two employees work closely together.",0,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?

Explanation:
1. **Jack Patel**:
   - **Threat severity**: This aspect is not explicitly mentioned in Jack's profile.
   - **Self-efficacy**: Not strongly highlighted.
   - **Intent**: Jack demonstrates intent, especially towards relationships and adhering somewhat to security protocols.
   - **Belief**: Jack believes in the importance of using information security resources appropriately.

Given Jack Patel's belief that relationships are more important than following rules and procedures, there is a potential risk of him engaging in or tolerating information security misconduct. Olivia Rodriguez, while committed to safeguarding company assets, also emphasizes the importance of adhering to regulations and may not be proactive in initiatives supporting the company's progress. If they work together, Jack's tendency to prioritize relationships over rules may influence Olivia's less active stance on security initiatives, thereby increasing the risk of non-compliance.",0,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?

To increase information security compliance, it would be beneficial to target and strengthen the ""Goal"" cognitive behavioral factor. Jack Patel prioritizes relationships over rules and procedures, which indicates a potential misalignment in goals regarding the importance of information security. Aligning his personal goals with organizational goals related to data security could foster better compliance. Similarly, though Olivia Rodriguez is committed to safeguarding company assets, her sporadic participation in initiatives supporting the company's progress suggests a potential area for improving goal alignment and engagement. By emphasizing the importance of shared goals and the alignment of personal and organizational objectives related to information security, both individuals could be encouraged to adhere more strictly to security protocols.",1,3

Explanation: While both Olivia Garcia and Ethan Nguyen value safeguarding their organization’s assets, there are some concerns that could affect the overall security posture. Olivia appears to follow the rules mainly for incentives, which may mean her commitment is contingent on external rewards.

(option c) - ['Group norms', 'Moral', 'Knowledge', 'Costs', 'Belief']

Here’s the reasoning for both individuals:

- Ethan Nguyen's statements reflect constructs such as 'Group norms' (desiring to follow security guidelines and involving others in security policies), 'Moral' (dedicated to security measures), 'Knowledge' (advocating for security measures), 'Costs' (from his own perspective on compliance), and 'Belief' (in his urge to exploit information security).

While Ethan Nguyen shows motivation for information security on the surface, he has expressed a conflicting urge to exploit the system.
