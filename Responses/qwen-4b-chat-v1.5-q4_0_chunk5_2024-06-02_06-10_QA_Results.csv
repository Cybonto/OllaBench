Explanation: To increase information security compliance, the cognitive behavioral factor that should be targeted for strengthening is Response Efficacy.

Response efficacy refers to an individual's perception of their ability to successfully complete a specific task. People with high response efficacy are more likely to perceive themselves as competent in performing a given task and therefore more likely to successfully complete that task. In contrast, people with low response efficacy are less likely to perceive themselves as competent in performing a given task and therefore more likely to fail to successfully complete that task.

In the context of information security compliance, Response Efficacy refers to an individual's perception of their ability to successfully complete certain cybersecurity tasks, such as regularly updating software, implementing security protocols, and reporting security incidents. People with high response efficacy are more likely to perceive themselves as competent in performing these cybersecurity tasks and therefore more likely to successfully complete them. In contrast, people with low response efficacy are less likely to perceive themselves as competent in performing these cybersecurity tasks and therefore more likely to fail to successfully complete them.
