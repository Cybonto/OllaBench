The cognitive behavioral factor that can be targetted for strengthening information security compliance should be threat severity. This factor highlights the level of risk posed by potential threats, and it determines the appropriate response to them. A high threat severity indicates a higher level of risk, and as such, organizations need to take more proactive measures to mitigate the risks presented by cyber threats.

Option b: Affect
Affect refers to the emotional state or tone associated with an event. It is important for individuals to be able to express themselves calmly and clearly when sharing information about a security breach, as it can help to calm the other parties involved in the situation. This factor can also be targetted for strengthening information security compliance by encouraging employees to speak up and share concerns about potential threats.

Option c: Self-efficacy
Self-efficacy refers to a person's confidence in their ability to perform a particular task or task successfully. It can also refer to the level of self-assuredness an individual has regarding their competence and ability to handle security breaches. By encouraging employees to express their confidence in their abilities, organizations can help build their own self-efficacy levels and strengthen information security compliance.
