When two employees with different approaches to information security work closely together, it can create a situation where the security non-compliance risk level may increase. This is because their differing perspectives on compliance and usage of computer resources could lead to confusion or disagreements about how to handle specific tasks or situations. It's also possible that one employee's adherence to strict policies could be undermined by the other's more lax approach, potentially leading to a lack of awareness about the importance of computer security within the team. Additionally, if both employees are not fully aware of the organization's Information Security Policies or how to utilize cybersecurity defense programs effectively, this could also increase the risk of non-compliance. Therefore, it is essential for the team members to collaborate and understand each other's perspectives to establish a cohesive approach to information security within the team.",1,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?

Working closely together in the same team may result in a higher risk of security non-compliance for several reasons. First, having two different perspectives and approaches to information security within the same team can lead to conflicts or misunderstandings regarding best practices and policies. This could potentially result in one or both individuals neglecting important security protocols, increasing the overall risk level.

Additionally, the combined influence of both employees may lead to a more relaxed attitude towards compliance, as they might feel that their differing viewpoints balance each other out, rather than reinforcing the importance of strict adherence to rules and guidelines. This could create an environment where non-compliance becomes more likely or is perceived as less important.

Lastly, the increased collaboration between the two employees may expose previously unexploited vulnerabilities in the company's security measures. If they are not careful and diligent in addressing these vulnerabilities, it could lead to a higher risk of non-compliance incidents.",0,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?

By addressing her concerns about minimal expenses and potential harm to employee trust, she may become more confident in her ability to follow these policies effectively.

For Matthew Yang, increasing self-efficacy could help him understand that obeying information security policies would not hinder his success but rather contribute to it.

Working closely in the same team could lead to an increased risk of security non-compliance for several reasons. Both Sophia Patel and Ethan Brown have different perspectives on information security, with Sophia prioritizing adherence to policies and Ethan valuing pleasing their boss over following protocols.

If they work together closely, there is a possibility that their differing approaches could lead to misunderstandings or conflicts in implementing security measures.

This could result in a weakened security posture and an increased risk of non-compliance.

Tyler Campbell seems to have a high commitment to following information security policies, showing a clear understanding of the importance and benefits of such policies. The individual values the institution's security policies and aims to follow through with the organization's safety protocols. This suggests that Tyler has a strong sense of commitment towards information security.

Benjamin Evans, on the other hand, shows a lack of comprehension in meeting job requirements when it comes to information security policies. While they expressed their desire to safeguard their organization's information and technology assets, their department lacks strict enforcement of these policies among employees. This indicates that Benjamin may not fully understand the norms and benefits of following information security protocols, making them more vulnerable to potential breaches. However, their statement about following the policies if they had a better understanding suggests that they are open to learning and committing to information security once they gain more knowledge and see the benefits.",0,"Who is MORE compliant with information security policies?

However, the best fit for this specific case would be option (d) - ['Norms', 'Motivation', 'Attitude', 'Group norms', 'Goal'], as it captures the different aspects of their behavior related to information security.

Subjective norms, goal, intent, control, and motivation are part of the theory of planned behavior (TPB), which is a model that explains an individual's intention to perform or not perform a particular behavior. In this case, Emily Johnson and Ethan Patel are discussing their attitudes and intentions regarding information security measures in their respective organizations.

Emily Johnson acknowledges her responsibility and promise to safeguard the valuable assets of her company, while Ethan Patel values following the institution's Information Security Policies as an essential duty.

When employees with differing levels of commitment to information security work closely together, there is potential for the security non-compliance risk level to increase. In Liam Johnson's case, while he values the protection of their employer's information and understands the significance of following the organization's security protocols, there might be situations where he may not prioritize these protocols as much as Samantha Green does.

Samantha Green, on the other hand, is enthusiastic about their level of empowerment in safeguarding the business and complies with security procedures, which could lead to an over-reliance on her own understanding and implementation of security protocols. If she were to influence Liam Johnson or others in the team to take shortcuts or not adhere strictly to established processes, this could increase the risk of non-compliance with information security protocols.

In conclusion, while both employees appear committed to information security, working closely together may lead to a change in the overall security non-compliance risk level within the team due to differing levels of commitment and potential influence between the two individuals.",1,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?

Working closely in the same team could potentially lead to a higher risk of security non-compliance. This is because, when two employees with different levels of strictness in following security protocols work together, it can create conflicts and confusion about which procedures should be followed. Additionally, one employee's determination to follow rules too stringently might hinder the other employee's ability to work efficiently or could lead to a lack of understanding between the team members regarding how best to safeguard sensitive assets. Therefore, the security non-compliance risk level may increase in such a scenario. It is crucial for the team to establish clear communication and alignment on security protocols to mitigate these potential risks.",1,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?
