Based on the provided intelligence, Emily Davis has an inner circle that expects strict adherence to company security measures and a general alignment with utilizing security technologies.

Olivia Smith, on the other hand, is motivated to follow security protocols by incentives and shows dedication to advancing organizational security measures.

Combining these two individuals into the same team could increase the risk of security non-compliance due to the potential influence Emily Davis might have if her intentions were to misuse security resources. If Olivia's adherence to policies is primarily incentive-driven, it might not be strong enough to counterbalance any negative behavior or influence from Emily.
