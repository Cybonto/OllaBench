Explanation:
An employee who works with others who share the same technology or work environment could have a higher risk of exposing sensitive company data through a common network, cloud, or other system. For example, if two developers are working on the same project, there is a greater chance that they will make changes to the code, which can be accessed by both parties without proper security measures in place. In this case, it may increase the risk of information being compromised.

Option (b): Security non-compliance risk level will increase due to employees working closely in the same team.

Explanation:
If two employees working in a similar department or project share the same technology or work environment, there is a greater chance that they may have access to sensitive company data. For example, if both are assigned to a task related to improving security policies for the organization, it's possible that they will work on the same program without proper security measures in place. This increased risk can lead to compromising of the organization's information security policies and procedures.

Option (c): Security non-compliance risk level will stay the same due to a lack of close ties between team members.

Explanation:
If there are no direct connections between team members, such as when two employees are working on different projects or teams within the organization, it is not likely that they will be exposed to sensitive company data through a common network or cloud environment. This lack of exposure can lead to more focused work, fewer errors made in the system, and increased security for the entire organization.",1,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?

By doing so, organizations can increase their likelihood of complying with their security protocols and minimize potential risks to sensitive data or assets. Some of the benefits that cognitive behavioral factors might offer are:

1. Increased awareness: When employees have a better understanding of the importance of information security, they are more likely to take steps to protect company assets from cyber threats. This can include regular training, implementing policies and procedures, and regularly monitoring network activity for signs of suspicious behavior or activities.

2. Improved compliance: Companies that prioritize information security protocols are more likely to avoid costly penalties, such as fines or reputational damage, when they inadvertently breach their security policies. This is because companies that follow the proper protocols tend to have a better understanding of the risks associated with cyber threats and can take steps to mitigate them before they escalate into larger issues.

3. Improved productivity: Companies that are more secure tend to have fewer security incidents, which can lead to higher employee satisfaction and retention rates. Additionally, better protection of assets means employees can focus on their core duties without being constantly aware of potential hazards. 

4. Enhanced reputational value: Companies that prioritize information security are seen as more secure organizations by the public, which can lead to increased trust and favorable reputation. This can have a positive impact on companies' financial performance as well as their ability to attract talent and investors.",0,1

For example, someone who follows a strict information security policy may feel more comfortable taking risks and performing tasks outside of their comfort zone. This person may also have less fear of being held accountable for violating the company's policies. Alternatively, someone who values integrity and honesty may adopt a ""zero tolerance"" approach to cybersecurity that prioritizes preventing data breaches and protecting sensitive information.

A person who believes that cybersecurity is a matter of individual responsibility, rather than a shared responsibility between all individuals, may feel less pressure to follow institutional policies.
