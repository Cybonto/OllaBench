Security non-compliance risk level may increase in the following scenarios:

1. Close proximity to sensitive information: As mentioned earlier, employees working closely in a team may be more likely to violate security protocols. This is because they are less likely to notice or question infractions of policies and procedures that apply to the entire team. 2. Uncertainty regarding security policies: If there is no established policy for information security in the organization, employees may struggle to adhere to it, and this could lead to non-compliance. It is possible that employees working in the same department may disagree on what constitutes a violation of security protocols, leading to confusion and potentially increased risk. 3. Trust issues: If an employee feels that their workplace doesn't have a clear set of policies and procedures for information security, they may feel more inclined to compromise or engage in risky activities in order to maintain their job. However, even if security non-compliance occurs in this way, it is unlikely to significantly impact the organization's overall security posture.

This cognitive behavioral factor can be further divided into three subgroups: Goal-setting, goal-reaching, and goal-achievement.

1. Goal-setting:
The goal of information security compliance is to ensure that the company's data is protected against unauthorized access or use, and to implement policies to minimize risks associated with such breaches. To achieve this goal, the organization should prioritize setting clear goals for information security that are specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). Setting goals that align with the company's core values and mission can help employees understand why they are working towards a common goal.

2. Goal-reaching:
Information security compliance should be a continuous process rather than a one-time event. To achieve this, the organization should establish measurable goals that are specific and attainable over time. For example, setting a quarterly goal for reducing cybersecurity incidents can help ensure progress is being made and encourage employees to work towards these goals.

3. Goal-achievement:
Information security compliance cannot be achieved without the support of employees. To achieve this goal, the organization should provide incentives or rewards for employees who successfully achieve their goals. This could include monetary rewards, recognition, and a company-wide culture that prioritizes information security compliance.

In summary, to increase information security compliance, the cognitive behavioral factor targetted for strengthening should be Goal. The organization can use these three subgroups to focus on goal setting, goal reaching, and goal achievement. These strategies will help ensure that employees are working towards common goals, which in turn will encourage them to take ownership of information security compliance and lead to a more robust and effective response to breaches.",0,0

Cognitive Behavioral Factor (CBF)
A CBF approach is a comprehensive and systematic way of developing and implementing an organization's information security policies. It is designed to enhance the knowledge, understanding, and skills required for effective information security management in organizations. The CBF approach emphasizes four core factors: social, response efficiency, attitude, and behavioral change.

Social Factor
A key factor in enhancing information security compliance is the adoption of sound social norms. Adopting good social norms is crucial for creating a culture that values data protection, privacy, confidentiality, and security. Good social norms promote teamwork, respect, honesty, integrity, accountability, transparency, trust, and collaboration.

Response Efficacy Factor
The response to information security incidents is an essential factor in ensuring effective compliance with the organization's information security policies. Effective response plans should be developed and tested to ensure that they are clear, concise, and easy to understand. Good response planning provides a framework for responding to potential threats and emergencies, and helps mitigate the impact of such events.

Attitude Factor
The attitude towards information security is an essential factor in ensuring effective compliance with the organization's information security policies. A positive attitude towards information security can help motivate staff to take proactive measures to safeguard company assets. Positive attitudes promote a culture of trust, confidence, and reliability within the workplace.

Behavioral Change Factor
The behavioral change factor is crucial for ensuring effective compliance with information security policies. Good behavioral change can help employees adopt positive attitudes towards information security, which in turn helps to improve information security compliance. Effective behavioral change programs can include training, communication strategies, and organizational initiatives that encourage staff to take proactive measures to safeguard company assets.",1,2
