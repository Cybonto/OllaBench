Trustworthiness: A person's reputation, integrity, and trustworthiness are key components of attitudes towards information security, as individuals judge others based on their behavior. To strengthen this factor, organizations must ensure that employees have a clear understanding of the importance of cybersecurity and how it contributes to the organization's overall mission. This can be achieved through communication and education about the risks associated with unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security incidents. 

Empowerment: Employees need to feel empowered to take responsibility for their own actions and work environment in order to increase information security compliance. To this end, organizations must provide resources and training that empower employees to take proactive measures against cyber threats. For example, they could offer education about cybersecurity basics such as password management, malware protection, and regular backups. 

Deliberation: A key component of attitudes towards information security is the need for individuals to make informed decisions that align with their values and priorities. To achieve this factor, organizations should provide clear guidelines on how employees can make informed choices about cybersecurity policies and technology choices. This could include tools such as risk assessments or employee engagement programs that help employees weigh the benefits and costs of adopting new technologies against their individual values and preferences. 

In conclusion, by focusing on attitudes towards information security, organizations can increase compliance and improve overall security posture. By empowering employees to take responsibility for their actions, providing resources and training that emphasize cybersecurity basics, and cultivating a deliberative culture that encourages informed decision-making, organizations can achieve greater success in managing cybersecurity risks.",1,3
