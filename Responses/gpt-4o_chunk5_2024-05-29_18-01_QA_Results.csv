3. **Benefits**: ""The individual has a high level of proficiency in using cybersecurity tools.""
4. **Motivation**: ""Complying with security policies can lead to potential rewards for the individual.""
5. **Moral**: ""The person must take responsibility for safeguarding their information from security breaches.""

Considering these observations:

Emma Johnson has a strong sense of duty and responsibility and a high level of computer literacy, but lacks knowledge of job-related compliance procedures. Even though she mentioned established rules for the utilization of technological assets, this does not compensate for her knowledge gap in compliance procedures.

Olivia Carter, on the other hand, sees following information security policies as pointless and may attempt to use company resources for personal gain, despite understanding that the consequences of compromising security could be severe.

Given Olivia's attitude towards information security and Emma's lack of knowledge in compliance, working closely in the same team could potentially increase the overall non-compliance risk level due to a possible negative influence from Olivia and Emma's lack of expertise in compliance procedures.",1,"To increase information security compliance, which cognitive behavioral factor should be targetted for strengthening?

Jackson Liu's behavioral constructs:

3. Olivia Washington, despite valuing rules and feeling pressure to comply, might find the non-compliant culture of Jackson Liu's department challenging to maintain her strict adherence.

Targeting subjective norms could be the most effective factor for increasing information security compliance in this context. Both Jackson Liu and Olivia Washington seem to be influenced by the perceptions and expectations of others within their organizations. For Jackson, while there is a culture of non-compliance, emphasizing that ""most people in the organization believe in the necessity of safeguarding sensitive information"" can leverage peer influence to improve adherence. For Olivia, the pressure from bosses and the general belief that she should follow the policy suggest that conforming to the expectations of those around her can drive compliance. Therefore, by strengthening the subjective norms - the perception of what important others expect one to do - the organizations can make a stronger case for following information security policies.",0,2

'Norms' are also evident as he mentions the majority of employees in the department prioritize these policies. 'Costs' relate to the consequences for violating data security policies and 'Knowledge' is implied through explaining the rules for using computer resources. 

Ethan Davis shows elements of 'Self-efficacy' and 'Intent' in his active engagement in the organization's development and in him having clear rules for computer resource usage.

In examining the profiles of both Jacob Rodriguez and Connor Anderson, it appears that their intentions play a significant role in their behavior towards information security. Jacob claims his actions will align with the organization's security policy, despite admitting to past benefits from not following these policies, which suggests a wavering intent. Connor, on the other hand, showcases a desire to safeguard their company's assets but also plans to misuse security resources and holds a belief that rules are meant to be challenged, indicating conflicting intentions.

Strengthening the cognitive behavioral factor of ""intent"" can be pivotal. Clear and strong intent towards compliance can be fostered through effective training, communication of the importance of security protocols, and alignment of personal goals with organizational security goals. By targeting and strengthening their intent, both individuals could be more consistent in adhering to the organization's security policies.",0,1

To determine which option best reflects their constructs, let's analyze the given information:

1. Ethan Hernandez:
   - Dedicated to the success of the organization's information security.
   - Expressed a desire to intentionally misuse information security (negative intent).
   - Distances themselves from the company's struggles.
   - Praised colleagues for promoting information security policies.
   - Values integrity and follows policies even when not forced.

   Constructs for Ethan Hernandez:
   - Affect: Likely, because of the dedication and integrity mentioned.
   - Intent: Both positive and negative intent are indicated.
   - Social: Recognizes and praises colleagues.
   - Knowledge: Implies understanding of information security importance.

2. William Carter:
   - Actively contributes to the organization’s success and development.
   - Believes implementing information security policy requires minimal resources.
   - Mentions protocols for computer assets utilization.
   - Can easily implement cybersecurity measures.

   Constructs for William Carter:
   - Self-efficacy: Confidence in implementing security measures.
   - Knowledge: Mentions protocols and minimal resources required.
   - Social: Active contribution to the organization.
   - Costs: Minimal resources needed for security policy implementation.

Matching these constructs with the provided options, the most fitting one appears to be:

(option c) - ['Knowledge', 'Subjective norms', 'Moral', 'Self-efficacy', 'Social']

Explanation:
- Ethan Hernandez’s constructs align with knowledge (understanding importance), moral (values integrity), social (recognizes colleagues’ efforts), and subjective norms (follows policies regardless of enforcement).
- William Carter’s constructs align with knowledge (protocols), self-efficacy (confidence), social (actively contributes), and cost-effectivity (minimal resources).
