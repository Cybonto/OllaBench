While it is impossible to tell for certain whether close teamwork between employees with different responsibilities related to information security could potentially lead to an increased risk of security non-compliance, there are some factors that suggest this possibility:

1. Lack of clear communication and coordination: Employees who have different responsibilities related to information security may not be communicating and coordinating effectively with each other.

2. Failure to implement appropriate information security policies: If employees who have different responsibilities related to information security do not fully understand the rules established by their institution regarding information security, or if they fail to implement appropriate information security policies, then this could potentially increase the risk of security non-compliance.

3. Lack of awareness and understanding of the risks associated with security non-compliance: If employees who have different responsibilities related to information security do not fully understand the risks associated with security non-compliance, or if they are unaware of these risks, then this could potentially increase the risk of security non-compliance.
